Author: Anand Mehto
Domain: Natural Language Processing (NLP) / Sentiment Analysis
Project Type: Exploratory Data Analysis + NLP + Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project analyzes airline customer reviews to understand passenger sentiment and identify factors influencing satisfaction. Using NLP techniques and machine learning models, the project classifies reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments and provides insights for airlines to improve customer experience.

Dataset

Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns in airline reviews.

Clean and preprocess text data (removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing tokenization).

Implement NLP techniques such as:

Text vectorization (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer)

Sentiment classification using ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)

Visualize results using graphs and word clouds.

Provide actionable insights for airlines to enhance customer satisfaction.

Key Features / Steps

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and text preprocessing.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Sentiment distribution, airline-wise comparison, and top keywords.

NLP Processing: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization/stemming.

Model Building: Sentiment classification using ML models and evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score).

Visualization: Word clouds, bar charts, and sentiment trends.

Tools & Libraries

Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

NLP: nltk, scikit-learn, re, wordcloud

Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)
