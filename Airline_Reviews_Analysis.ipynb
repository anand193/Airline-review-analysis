for future passengers  very poor experience first computer problem now seat malfunction stuck missing meeting in san diego  i tried that you offered to charge me an additional k for a new ticket or be stranded until thurs st time last time  never had a bad experience before but this one took the cake now extortion for carry on items as well  had to spend  hours worrying that items in carryon would be brokenstolen since i couldnt carry them on plane or lock bag  all of group e was told there was no more room in the bins when i got on the plane was room for at least  bags in my row  thanks for making my flight from lax to jfk a nightmare by forcing me to check my carry on bag at the gate   i have lots of flights to book and your site it not working ive been on the phone waiting for over  minutes  why is it taking  years to fly home to dallas get your shit together  man of steel flies to more cities thoughand with more frequency too  started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me  while other airlines werent cancelled flighting flights into bos and helping their customers get home virgin was saying good luck  grouping virgin in with the others now bos weather has exposed their actual cus serv model never flight booking problems with virgin again  as one of the travelers affected by the boston storm im shocked at virgins complete apathy toward their customers  umm so no reason as to why this is is there someone different i should contact or contact me to get a definitive answer  trying to make the change in advance not just  hours priortried it online earlier and it wanted  in change fees  mood lighting on point reclining my seat kickin up my feet  my flight  scheduled for pm departure still says on time but no plane at gate any update on how long of a delay  my group got their cancelled flightlation fees waived but i cant because my ticket is booked for  your reps were no help either   still no refund or word via dm please resolve this issue as your cancelled flightled flight was useless to my assistants trip  delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because theres a long line for deicing still need to improve service united  your eriord express connections are hugely popular  now if only we could have an eriewr hop   you think you boarded flight au too early i think so  gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights if you have a way to prevent the constant issues that would rock  is the worst nonrefundable first class tickets oh because when you select globalfc their system auto selects economy wupgrade   so i can buy tix  days before flight but cant transfer the tix  flawed security logic flawed customer service  i did start a claim but  weeks is unrealistic am i really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my childridiculous  if the car seat is lost  should just reimburse me for a new one this is not a pair of shoes its a necessity for my child   that totally sucks my cousin worked at phl said   beginning of feb i called united they said they would send another voucher by mail never got anything tiredofwaiting  the internet is a great thing  i am emailing executives in your company maybe they will respond to me in a timely manner  thats weak see ya \\nhey    i flew back w other company since united didnt have an earlier flight  i am trying to book awards for september and need flights on  but they will not show even w many award seats availab  i sure did   i had to drive a total of  hours to get my own bag  id like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me  see we were told repeatedly that the pilot was late flight and kept getting late flightr  after we boarded there was a defibrillator issue  why no preferred security line anymore my tsa precheck didnt pull on my  partner flight platinum spoiled  newarkliberty airport need to indicate different gates for terminals aampc flyingainteasy  yes please i am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight it seems so easy but  how does united refuse to reissue a  lost voucher when their plane didnt take off due to mechanics badcustomerservice  also during the run i was instructed to do i shattered my computer   yes weve been with the agents for the last  minutes one of the agents have been very rude but thankfully ladan has been nice  iah to charlotte baggage claim rep latrice h customerservice non existent ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer    i would have loved to respond to your website until i saw the really long form in business the new seats are bad  a refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today  hour drive is very inconvenient  then why have i not received my call back its been  daysits an infant car seat how am i supposed to go anywhere with my child  well sitting on the ground on time but waiting for a gateagain tiredofthis  no i need you guys to not over book planes its not a concern ill just travel with someone else moving forward  a measly  ecertificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait hrs on the tarmac during ua unacceptable  when will email addressusername signon be available its been a while  rude rude   why cant i get a boarding pass for my austrian airlines codeshare flight rebook incls a  hour layover amp i am stuck outside sec  i received on other flights united  truly breaks guitars unitedbreaksguitars wantmymoneyback  just flew to telaviv paid  from a third suitcase which didnt even make it on the plane besides for the impolite service   my bag is still in colo springs i am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag not a good outcome  shame that theres no flex to tickets transfer rules  even calling from neurosurgery icu isnt enough  no denver said they dont handle baggage that made it to colo springs  they gave me an  number to call no help there either  you guys need some serious training in customer service too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes  once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague was told we cant find a supervisor  zccu cancelled flight flight h in advance need connect flight reschedule so the link isnt helping help gf waited months to see me  i will not be flying you again  in addition my first flight was delayed an hour and im arriving at my destination  hrs late flight  our travel booked thru united group dept okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in lax  v upset with your disability  services when i told one of your employees i was carrying medical equipment she was very rude  thnx for quick reply but dont think you can assist our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today  wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an  yr old whos active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery wow    weeks late flightr and i still have not received my miles from the mileageplus gift card  starbucks card i handed over  as a k im always hoping for improvement  not yet i complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around unfortunate coincidence i hope  okc ticket agent roger mclarrensp less than helpful with our intl group travel problems cant find a supervisor for help  mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each os category  its expensive to get right   another fail for the united ticket agents in okc less than helpful and could care less about our problems american here we come  i just sent an email to customer care telling them i may have to break up with you  i sincerely hope they can help me  silly im flying delta today your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk  what is your phone number i cant find who to call about a flight reservation  well you cant fix me missing my buddies th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it  why am i to believe they will help when customer service couldnt like i said i want a number to someone who can fix what you did  they helped me at the baggage service desk  said bc tsa screening was down in fll not all bags made it but bag will be in ewr    mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board second time this week hmm  had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my  was not a guide dog  whats the point of asking for details about a servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesnt read them continued  i tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in houston i was stuck for  hours because of you guys  worstunitedflightsever ua  las to iad  mechanical problems again  took off  had to land for fix  delayed again wtfodds  whats going on with ua   outbound flight last thurs was delayed hrs how long will this delay be worstunitedflightsever  worstunitedflightsever ua iad to las  mechanical problems  switched aircraft delayed  hours  crashed trying to check in  on  to logan  boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement bins full of coats  no room for bags u need a better system  blackmailed me into paying  extra or having my return ticket nullified in san francisco airport terrible service from rep scam  disappointed that u didnt honor my  credit given to me for ur mistakes taking my business elsewhere  out  ua still waiting supposed to depart   it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail  ok its now been  months waiting to hear from airline i gave them quite a bit more than the  days requested terrible service  does this process ever end still waiting for the reply since  months pathetic customerservice  whats going on with your website im flight booking problems three tickets today and ive been booted off the system umpteen times  how do i get my account number if your website says email is unavailable  i received  bag last night i am still missing the other one   youll need to upgrade the seats too even in economy plus its like sitting on a concrete bench  nd flight also delayed no pilots but they boarded is so we can just sit here scheduling  but its hard to stay upset at someone when they at least try to show remorse  by the way a simple apology goes a long way even if its a hollow one its obvious that you dont care about me or my wellbeing  this isnt a one time thing either its a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect  fingers crossed amp its all intact very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you  its an incredibly easy fix but you would rather stay in your comfort zone while i get forced out of mine  ours in july you have zero excuses for this you have an outofdate system that causes problems like this  everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members they booked their tickets in october and december we bought  not sure what you are talking about she is going on nonstop flights sna to sfo and then sfo to ewr  it will be because im moving to  because of  talk no service  i asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs localized problems and got back an unrelate flightd copypaste you can do better  what time who can i call i need my skis i will go to the airport and get them no more faith in united  i see you guys are at it again amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error  yeah sorry but theres always a problem with united and you have an international reputation for having problems  but then again maybe the  would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused  i wonder if sharing all this on fb and insta would produce a number  characters really limits my story telling  so youre telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff  could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived  you have to follow me in order for me to dmcome on now   united coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a hour flight seriously ridiculousness learncustomerservice  so they didnt drop my bag overnight amp now im leaving for a week this is why you were

customer service is atrocious you have disrupted my travel plans you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to talk to a human  terminal at mia should have food open before am esp when there are

for shower then left to find hotel u know how many passengers u carry planning  completed form but doubt its any use ua doesnt care  day vacation will now be  sure ua wont feel responsibility for that  nope they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport even though they assured us we would get a room  back for the expensive holiday he worked all year to pay for that you ruined we want compensation amp his original case back  thanks united i understand that but he would actually like his own bag back what have you done with it he also wants the money  frankly worse customer service ever problems will happen how you deal defines a company never again united  its still a valid flight just seems strange to delay for late flight inbound crew   hours from now when the plane is already here  thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the k desk    its too bad ua has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight  if i pay you  and  for my luggage to be delivered when i arrive why should i have to wait  additional days for its delivery  so  hotels for  people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we cant leave fail  outbound  bags  lbs bags returning home  bag  lbs what is your logic and why am i writing to a machine human help required    we dont like to hear you had a poor experience please share details wour customer care team   no cancelled flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in late flight getting runaround for  hrs each employee blaming  previous   okay asem find our luggage  the agent that met us at the gate said any issues wdelays on ua would have to be taken up online  but they are not lady one phone says its in tel aviv tel aviv united says its in newark no one knows and i have nothing  yes but still now answers many have not had their luggage for  days unacceptable  what is that going to do for you nothing just like you always do  plus what about food and taxis  you are offering us  rooms for  people fail   people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing  the bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me hope youre having a good night thanks  i take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us a so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything fail  on  arriving two hours late flight into clt now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate unhappy customer  airlines is the absolute worst they have no idea what they are doing neveragain unitedairlines  thanks might want to fix this line our customer care team is currently responding to most inquiries within  business days  its frustrating as a

connection at ord was on the exact same plane again checked carryon was apparently taken off amp left in chicago pretty ridiculous  not encouraged that ill have my cpap tonight  yes did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it got an email that its found but not sched for delivery   delay dencle because they have to manually enter baggage tags really worst cust service day for this ker friendlyskies  why tell us flight is delayed then tell us its on time again with  min to spare dont say its delayed unless youre sure  yes in lusaka zambia my guess is the bags never

being loaded min late flight frigid air into cabin plane feels like falling apart upgrade long haul fleet  flight attendant never served me my beverage tea and not once checked up on me what gives ua notcool  load balancing system apparently down systemwide  major impact on all united airlines flights was this a cyberattack  after our unscheduled refueling stop and missing  connecting flights we r home n looking ward to our bed and a big pbampj sandwich   spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet  ua sitting at ewr nearly an hour after sked  pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave  can you help   so thats it it just ends there come on i traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this  i received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when i arrived im asking for all  people to be refunded  updated a aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets i dont get it how can i charge devices  was no one between the scan and inside the plane i just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going   gate changes two delays  even the crew thinks the airline sucks  im very frustrated and have wasted  days now due to your equipment failures  computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app thats just ridiculous keep people updated  soooo its been  days and youve offered no response so i assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now  calls to  resulted in hrs of hold time amp day wait to check suspect code share fare nothing investigatedmy time wasted   its taken  weeks for cust care to respond to case  requesting a refund for wifi not working where can i get an update  thats corrective spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button   today was not your finest all could have been prevented by one gate agent advising  passengers   what is the real deal with the delay on flight ua  from denver to vegas  ua from madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by  ua employees maryjo was rude and unhelpful  system failure again  bad trend  software projects are like flying an airplane theres no such thing as an emergency takeoff  lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week currently sitting on the tarmac at ogg for over an hour   however is completely under your controlthe price was and still is displayed on   can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased  comically on the return flight from ase there were two united flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board  grkm is the file reference  we wouldhow do i contact you to discuss a few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot  ua  pacific rim and date night cut out not constantly or randomly but one spot repeatably  been trying since  to file a report  i send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response  yet another reason why ill never fly with you again  here is the ticket   please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee  is horrible they lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat safety regulations say its illegal to use a used car seat  i dont care that a  link showed me a wrong price on your siteits your site amp responsibility to ensure correctness  he needs to get

unfriendlyskies   empathizes w my disappointment that stclass flight wnonworking entertainmnt is worth  unfriendlyskies   and when that doesnt work  searched for mileage tickets to bom couldnt find a single one is saver awards  i see how you play  earn miles but cant use them  flight arrives  minutes early but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags  thats not the issue the fact that no one

check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay poorcustomerservice  you cancelled flighted our flights for no reason amp now we have been on the phone for an hour on our vacation why   thats your response  shaking my head back and forth with a tsk you can do betterfrom customer service to your apology  of course i did the bag should be here by now  frustrated  you are the worst i will avoid you like the plague  is the worst airline in the world  someone needs to dm me and resolve this correctly extremely disappointed with the service i received terrible management  premier gold desk changes flight waives fees gives me wrong flight now jana acosta in salt lake refuses the same service angry  i will give you one thing you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well alwaysdelayedonunited  i will but right now im to angry  first time flying with united also last time terrible back to  for me branson virginatlantic unitedairlines  i used to be a committed continentalairlines flyer until merger i remember now why i switched to  communicationfail  the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just cancelled flighting my reservation because of your glitch notfair  im saying i made the flight but with poornoncommunication unaccounted for lost time amp lots of frustrated flyers standing around  i think dm would be better  gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says late flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth   you are easily the worst company i have ever experienced you have lost someones personal possessions amp you couldnt care less  how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to late flight arriving aircraft   already did that at the airport and  hrs late flightr its still not here you guys are really killing me today trying to stay positive  once uniteds service levels reaches those of etihad or lets be more realistically lufthansa then ill consider it again  really  someone called in sick and then someone forgot to call a replacement  now an hour late flight to take off theworst  asked flight attendant what typical compensation would be amp says we might get free tv unacceptable  has been such a disappointment today simply put rather unpleased with things currently flight delayed cant wait to just get home  during the same round trip my nonenglish speaking friend was stranded twice for  hours each time most staff members were rude   found a group of people who actually hates people more than isis thats right united airlines  nope walked up amp down the orf terminal amp not a united agent to be found showed up  last minute to board us many panicked people  by the time i finally get to dallas i could have driven with less frustration and cheaper  im trying to get to my final destination we need compensation just about hrs of personal time wasted  that guy really has no customer service cluecould have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine  how can you not put my bag on plane to seattle flight  waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag status should matter   hahaha if they werent an american company i would say this was great sarcasm  i think he actually did not like your screen     apparently they are asking  people to off board the planehow can such a big miscalculation be made  its a shame choosing united may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again poorservice  just checking in again  what is the status of our claim   it is going on  months with no attention to this   we are very upset  my flight was delayed due to maintenance in lit and caused me to miss my connection at iah to msy can you help  unitedairlines pls fix aspenbaggagefail issues had to pay my own way to aspen after flight cancelled flight left us in the cold in den  read my bio see who i work with i have never encountered this with your airline before disappointed is an understatement  does customer care have email or a phone rep that i can speak with we had so many issues they cant be placed in  characters  in the process of recovering their car rental  condo rental  in florida they called united for an alternate flight noanswer  weve been waiting on tarmac for gthr because apparently ua is overweight amp we returned to gate wtf fb  thank you mention that before i boarded she asked other person to measure their bag and it was another woman men not asked  cant leave the tarmac uniteds gate agent cannot agree on a head count  min now counting a  people max epicfailunited  thats real dedication amp concern your apologies dont fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues ive had over the past  mos  blocked me from dming them because they would rather i complain about them in a public forum  booked flights for  for  was charged  twice means i cant redeem cc points properly would have gone elsewhere  weve had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day whats up with that  pedophile airline split myself and my  yr old daughter rows apart on flight  to boston  have been waiting  days for my military bags from an airport  hours away from me horrible  arriving  minutes early is nice but not if equipment isnt ready waiting  minutes for luggage so far time gains wiped out  is doing musicians real dirty at lax ive never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass  im rebooked now but the line was  people deep   yes they said it took more than an hour  those whose pay to actually fly with you over k year deserve better service than a cc holder  not a happy flyer  ua flight  from sfo to cleveland  sunday   stay tuned for blog article from    min more delays to flt  at sfo  load  more pax makes no sense will strand many of us overnight at ord due to missed cnxns  heads up we didnt check  bags  we checked arrived those arent claim s for our  other peoples bags   this must be a drone   we understand your frustration our bag team is working hard to get your bags to you  change made in just over  hours for something that should have taken seconds online i am not thrilled loved the agent though  flight attendant doesnt understand not understanding english doesnt mean they are deaf stop yelling english slowly to them  not appropriate to ask in public hence the dm each united employee each a new answer your process was such a hassle i cancelled flighted  well thats big of you but i dont have terribly high expectations at this point  its like youre trying to make me hate your airline fee for each checked bag thats never mentioned in the ticket  rude agents   nice your app says us  delayed by weather  pilot says waiting on fuel  one in ur control one not  ok thank you do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since ill have to stay overnight  i was originally trying to share details but the link jimmy samartzis vice president  customer experience sent me expired  really  hr delay  gate changes amp you boarded us sent us back up amp boarded us again  wont change our flight can we go now  i did the ac went on for about  minutes before returning to the mojave desert pressurecooker heattrap  nope  still no one helped me  giving up on united badservice  when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up  id thank you  but you didnt help  taking  hours to reply so i get a message in the middle of the night isnt actually helpful  flight ua is descending into farce and we havent left ewr yet is this going to get any worse  i was told it was due to be on ua which flies direct to dublin so why did it go to london this is a complete shambles   min at ewr baggage claim stillnobags ridiculous  on a standby to denver which has been delayed and a confirmed to aspen whose flights have been cancelled flighted all day  confidence  yes at ambut now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue   at what pt do u just cancelled flight  finally got stndby  pm flight what a day  missedwork clientnothappy   dont see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats no airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early  woke up to notification flight moved  hrs early barely made flight then  hrs layover in sfo  wanted to hop on earlier option  i will do delayed baggage claim when i land hopefully the bag isnt broken into damaged or lost wc will result in more complaints  done want me to send a screen shot of the second call which is now at over  minutes  thanks ill fill up the form as soon as i land i dont like being duped so i hope you will appreciate my feedback amp will be better  this is the line in denver to rebook due to weather issues do better   the ones who suffer i understand delays i dont understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent   cancelled flighted flights late flightr agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then cancelled flighted it coworker got on flight now delayed now  of urgency but this is ridiculous your ceo claims to be customer focused yet when delays happen planes sit and customers are  i wasnt asking for a full refund but delaying me  hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit  flight was scheduled for  its  and we havent moved i have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense  go to hell  since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor why dont u reserve ohead space above those seats in b on ua  not impressed  would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights    flights so far this year  delays including  cancelled flightations  late flightst reason crew needed mandatory sleep in mexico the saga of the  bag delay w   will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping stay tuned  flight ord gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag ive used for  years flight crew was more reasonable  why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts  it was ua on  feb point is overselling flights bad making people wait hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse  weve been here since am and youve cancelled flightled our flight twice  no chance i wait in ord all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me hold   ua can wait for me im on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to b this is crap  from mex nrt dates tbd but im getting a  to  usd difference in my quotations through september when compared to mex bkk  better just keep connection

nowhereland have a gold reservation help  noooooooooooooooooooooope  oh we are sure its not planned but it occurs absolutely consistently its usually the only yyj flight thats cancelled flightled daily  its not getting any better id suggest you get a senior manager to this gate  then retrain these gate people    nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workersinstead united puts out a video of timco doing wifi  already missed  connection ugh    sure show a video of your outsourced favorite timco who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft  how do i formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me i was denied boarding amp i now lost my bag help  there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour not given any info  flight  iadsat were on the outdoor track for an hour   seriously its   no wifi on a hr flight from clesfo   youre the only airline wout wifiand pls no unwind bs  u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now hr delayed flight  linesforever customerservice fail again  youre the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare  what a pointless tweet at least  asked me to follow them to try and resolve  thats not even an apology  thats cool  now what   seriously its   no wifi on a hr flight from clesfo   youre the only airline without wifi  b boarding this attendant took his shoe ampsock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot so gross   unitedairlines so is it  pm or    ord abq    i cant even take a walk without missing a change  hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when i actually get on a flight as well as compensation for my hotel room  either is fine however plundering my hardearned dollars

incompetence i need to reschedule a connection i will never fly  again  youve been officially displaced by  for better flight experience pleasant cabin crew and timeliness ua m switching  you need a bag bouncer get it together   what is going on with uniteds mileage program you pay  for a ticket and get a fraction of that as pqd credit  you need to retrain your flight attendants saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is is not cool ua  was cancelled flightled not delayed  reflight booking problems still  miles from home  at least acknowledge the cancelled flightlation  never ever again will i be flight booking problems a flight with united or any affiliate if there is a chance to get on a united flight  three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats  and after being on hold for an hour the day before to sort it out and being told its fine it should be fine when you arrive to fly   its been almost  weeks and still no word from dot on update of london fare to us cities any updates on your end  well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change

house  i guess you have to follow me in order for me to send you a dm i tried and it wont send  stopped flying   yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon  listening to pssngrs forced to

online if i still have to wait in line for an hour to check in at counter fuckinlame    very poor customer service i will think again befor flight booking problems another united flight  an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat lastflightwithyouever  an efficient layout at kiosksbag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space additional friendly and helpful staff    of a planes passengers boarding in your premier groups might be an indication of a broken process  cancelled flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleepbut

change yet  flight landed  hours ago  more flights cmhiad last night and still no bagcould have driven it from cmh  do you have a further update on the suitcase today please  literally sucks  maybe be hiring your own ground staff at lax when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be hopeless  i would encourage you to reinterview the sole flight attendant on ual  from buf to ord blatantly not stable uncomfortable  this is the second time my flights been cancelled flightled like really  really st flt frm iad  iah is  late flight amp going via nashville inconvenience

is just annoying and seems like you have  clue  missed ua connection due  mechanical failure ua uplink prob i will lose  in clients mon how can you compensate  so you jacked out my cousins trip to portland and then cancelled flightled her return trip no more united  yes i did  we headed out to deice  minutes after i sent it to you  made it to austin but am now waiting for the luggage  after a cancelled flighted flight and  delays you lost my luggage again youre the worst disgraceful awful company horrible service  doesnt help the  or more passengers that just arrived an hour late flight   minutes on tarmac now thats after  hour delay  i am very glad i took care of own rescheduling now that ua  from ogg was cancelled flightled   tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message how can i tell if it went through   is flight  going to sit on the tarmac forever  one of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes her tone amp language was very unprofessional  thats why i blame your company because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons  sf crew lack a lot of customer service lax employees are a lot better wonder why  thats why i missed my flight if the flight had been held for  minutes i would have made it i watched it pull away from the gate  also didnt ice the frozen metal walkway wasted  minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs  your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the tarmac didnt have a gate agent once we got a gate  after  days   flight cancelled flightled another delay for  hours united gave me a  food voucher thats how much they value my time  checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass airlinesecurity  what the hell flight  delayed since  pm finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac is this fampampcking plane ever leaving  actually the flight was just cancelled flightled   i am a loyal premier platinum member but the lack of communication was really bad also i dont see that it has taken off yet  thanks for having changed me managed to arrive with only  hours of delay and exhausted  this is the nd time i was rebooked wdelays and for reasons unrelate flightd to weather how do i go about requesting a flight voucher  if you consider  mins for bags  pm on a sunday night as fast as they can you should reconsider what you think that means  its the horrible attitude from staff after  not just the delay not the level of service or respect one expects from united  why do you want me to be loyal  if dont let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead  on top of that i paid for st class and my wife got stuck in coach  ph the pat answers are bs after i was denied boarding it sat at the gate until  your employees totally suck  over the last week united has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life disgusting united   hrs since flight landed and zero info on my missing bag rough eta would be hugely helpful  restore some confidence  big surprise nogate waiting for our plane same fucken issues everything i fly you fail worstairlineever  not to belabor my pointbut shouldnt i be able to put a laptop bag above my seat  why is it announced to leave it for rollers thx  maybemange the airline alittlebetter arrived at lax and no gate howisthatpossible always the same thing wu  i just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed i can no longer see the status of my equipment  even after running to gate from your connecting flight your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked stranded  im desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this cancelled flightleddelayed flight  unacceptable ord  nope no more chances your airline messed up both ways of our trip  why announce it is for rollers at all if i want to put a coat in there isnt that my choice  how about all gate checked thx   bags left behind because plane overweight be great if knew as soon as we landed instead letting us wait  minutes with no info  you are a fampking joke your customer service is woeful if your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it  was a sponsor of the oscars no wonder it was a half hour delayed oscars  will lose my bag but wont give me free pretzels frauds  you are trying to charge me  bucks because you lowered your award tickets and i want to get my hard earn points back total bs  does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time gottogetbetter  apart from being on hold for over  hours and having talked to  people and the problem still not resolved  typical caned response from ua fix your crappy performing last placedranked airline in this century  is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor  customer service is the worst hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold  was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price  felt like a bait and switch tactic  love how you dont give a shit about people who tried to be loyal but you screw them every way till sunday glad ive stayed away  tried a different flight iahmnl   flights are advertised for  but are not bookable due to

attitude on the ground  liars united  here we go again  of  segments sfonew york rt were delayed over  hrs each why do you suck so badmaybe another line of bus  you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from maui to san francisco poor communication bad help in getting connections  if you dont like delayed bags why do you let it happen so much  the delay is due to customer service

making charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate brilliant  weve been waiting  min for a gate at sfo yet so many of them are free  your excellence in operational efficiency is showing

message its very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found this is truly worst service ever fedup disastrous  landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for  min maybe an update would be a good idea capt  wanted to point out that not one united crew has been sympathetic questions unanswered mileageplus is starting to look like a joke  can we get an explanation on why ua from so paulo to houston has been delayed now were hearing from crew about cancelled flightlations  why was flight  ewr to mco cancelled flightled for tomorrow and what do i do to rebook asking for a relative  i understand the intent was not to inconvenience but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasnt an option  wife landed in dc hrs ago luggage did not was told it would b deliveredhotel by pm its now pm no luggage ua  not sure why the people in row  that paid for a premium seat cant use their overhead space   is so cheap they couldnt afford to run the ac on ua they took pressure cooker to a new level cheap worstairline  why is it that sundays when my husband travels to chicago hes stuck at tarmac amp misses connecting flight always  well i can tell you that your customer service at rdu airport is horrific but is exception at ohare in chicago  sitting on ual   a comedy of errors  ual is incompetent  on ua tonight and told delayed due to late flight crew no

im really glad i just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail your customer service sucks nothing has been  you just caused a riot on the airplane never seen anything like this  instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every  min just say we will get you there when we get you there  so glad ive been waiting for  hour and  minutes and ive been transferred  times without resolving anything worst service ever  we still need help hung up on twice customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep  lol too little too late flight  yes bags came  hr after i arrived at baggage claim awful experience on the ground at bhm   your delay is due to your own making we have now been back to the gate multiple times maybe take accountability  why do i have to give up my leg room so these  people not in my row can fill the bin  pls start charging   please tell clt flight  needs a gate waiting now for  mins  why did you load

full dont reserve aisle   i sure will  any options to cos tonight doesnt look like ua will make it in time for ua should i reserve a hotel room  appreciated but in this case we waited an extra  minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log faxlike in the s  customer service sucks  they hang up after waiting an hour and talking for  minutes  jp  dm message who cant get a dm through to   strikes

to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse  i honestly couldnt tell you all i know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse  missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and i get that just wish it was handled better  ua has now had  different departure times wtf make up your mind  thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while newark tries to figure out which gate to go to incompetence  why doesnt my daughter booked with my gold member miles get on the upgrade list for her flight

kidding me i still havent talked to a human and your robotweeting me and asking for a follow  i wouldnt describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience to help you might find my baggage you lost amp return it  and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best  is that all that matters not the fact that were at a different destination we were put through a tremendous amount of stress  k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx ua awesome job  absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers isnt there anyone actively monitoring your cust serve this is  unreal  nice i wonder how you pick who to respond to maybe only happy customers are easier i wonder how many of those you have left  averaging  minute wait times tonight or what ive gotten no help from you tonight  thanks for nothing really  minute wait times when ive had to call back x thats minute wait times  youre customer service is unbelievably bad abysmal ive been on the phone for well over hrs tonight hung up on by yr ppl x  you can read the full story when i submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight  and why we are sleeping in dia  an inconvenience is a weather delay your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the faa wouldnt let him fly is negligence  i bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now i got an email that indicates united cancelled flightled my ticket why  new  plane wifi not working entertainment non existent new seats seriously uncomfortable really unitedfail ua   you sure missed the mark on tonights redeye from lax to chicago what a mess you can do better  after min of avoidable nonweather delays that appreciation link better be giving out

had st class seat orig i have a lousy coach seat  well this one missed the mark  she was in a snit from the minute i stepped up to the counter  who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you dont have enough flight attendants   weve been seating for hrs inside flight ua at iad delayed weve only been offered water amp cookies in business class failed  please get me off this plane ua  have since dropped to  layovers but still not acceptable  our  layover itinerary was swapped for a  layover itinerary  really  your app says flight ua to zrh departed hrs late flight but  hours

because of this i never get to use the tsa prescreen i paid for  boarding was decent  useless agents that dont speak english after hrs of hold hrs of mech delay not so much  flight was cancelled flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed  boarding a plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back makessense efficiency travel flying  its  and the desk attendant stated we would sit awhile until given the all clear lack of communication seems to the norm  had been suffering immensely ever since this merge  hopefully ill never have to fly  ever again   id really like to get off of this plane now  possibly the worst airlinegave them three chances second time in  weeks a flight has been delayed and or cancelled flightled due to mechanics  cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious flight  landed in washington because of it my head is pounding  sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and

of shit unitedsucks  what exactly do you hang on this hook    flight cancelled flightled  hrs at airport to book a new one for  just got two invoices for the flight each for approx  really  why do you hire pos pilots thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns  unitedsucksdick  your airline is again rated the worst in america so youve got your work cut out for you its bc you treat customers like garbage  pay for my hotel im a broke student help  all  of us are on standby in houston tomorrow for flights to calgary if you could get us on one or two of those that would help  what a nightmare  both sides of my flights are a disaster  at houston getting attitude cuz i was sent to ticket counter  youre terrible  it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes will be sent on but i wont be for days  anyone there did you read my dm  ewr to mco made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure worst pain ive ever felt i thought i was going to pass out  how does that make a flight takeoff on time and regardless it makes me late flight because now i have to wait for my bag at baggage claim  its been over

about halfway through the flight  unfortunately they didnt i asked the staff if they could help they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch but no one would  your baggage person told me to go

airline learn to check the weather and be honest  fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that i had a boarding pass and seat on full explanation and her name in complaint  god damn fucking crew wont be here till  so youve known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit  you really do have a culture problem everyone i tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how theyre

bag was amp each gave me different info ruined  events i had today disappointed  weve let you know how to help the millions of customers youve treated like garbage its no coincidence ur ranked worst airline  yes after landing at pm last night spoke to  baggage claim customer service reps finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent  charging  for biz flight to uk  somewhat egregious charging  on top for a sam adams draft at the united club is usurious  your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned   if you follow me i will dm you my phone  which you can call  flightua is basically a prison on the runway  sfo delays hrs of sitting no water no answers reminded y i hate this airline  says   is the final carrier  us air doesnt have it i want my bag not a claim not an im  sorry i want my clothes  seriously  hrs to get bags from iad intl arvls to carousel  for custs wcancelled flightled connects i understand irrops but ridiculous  most terrible flight experience happening to everyone right now on flightua  delays  hrs total missed all my flights now thnx     one of you has my bag claim  and i want it in mga now  you have failed so uncontrollably today that its beyond repair im beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations  a friend traveled via ua today and never got their luggage what recourse does the person have buy clothes and get reimbursed  i keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on  have tried at least x  you have a culture issue  rep wouldnt rebook this is such a waste of time and poor communication  my flight is late flight due to mechanical issues  of  flights in past  days  employees almost seem happy when delivery terrible customer service  its  how can my flight from a major city already be cancelled flightled  hours before departure due to weather  backup planes  been on hold on the phone for well over half an hour waiting to make a reservation change i wanted to make online help   instead had to wait on plane from ottawa that never came now im back home and have to try again tomorrow suitcase still lost  im glad u can solve the prob but my experience remains  will not fly again on united  u cancelled flighted my flight from iad to jax was supposed to use plane from bna but u used that plane for another destination instead   appreciate the early arrival of ua but any chance ord will ever bring the bags out  a broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from ua lhriah who can i email about this  just filled it out hope someone responds before we book our next trip  friends been sitting in houston since am flight cancelled flightedstill dont have any answers badcustomerservice  voucherwhatajoke  meant changed planes  i hate seating over wing if u wanted i would have booked it  u will get formal complaint  u guys did it again changed ages and double booked seats so i had to ive even though i have platinum and the other person none  havent before and havent this time amp have checked spamjunk mail just in casenothing  sloppy stuff you dont see anymore  united has raised my expectations  this team was poor  how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email  no bag tagging led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags  cabin crew were huge offenders stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers  allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane  no wheelchairs  no commitment to a good turnaround an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance  the nightmare continues   this team added  mins on turnaround  call wait times are over  minutes and airport wait times are longer  yes ive been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me  we are sitting on the runway for  hours it is ridiculous  no your service here pretty much ruined my day but thanks for the weak attempt  what you forgot to tell them the flight was coming thanks for allowing me to miss my connection  such as deodorant shampoo toothpaste seems like that would be limited to oz correct  why was i forced to check my rollaboard on ua  plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat   please dont take my membership away   please get me an economy plus seat awful day of  cancelled flighted flights after lots of planning  has me stranded weather not to blame hr hold to speak to an agent that doesnt understand the concept of time zones thanks  but your system gave my seat awaynow im l economy not econ  seat how did you give my plus seat away  yepused that twice no case id numbers assigned just tried it againget screen that says thank you for submitting your request  please you moved my seats and lost my upgrade i had seat l i have a ticket in my hand for l  any help is appreciated thats a looong wait for help on something thats not his fault  my husband is supposed to fly rdu to iad then iad to fra leaving in  hours you cancelled flighted his flight and theres a hr wait on phone  is probably the least satisfactory airline ive ever been on never fails to disappoint  not sure why u call it customer care  should be customer we dont care  who is in charge of making decisions over there cancelled flightling flight ua was unacceptable i should be in belize right now  i fly  normally  this doesnt happen to me with them  ill let your flyers provide their own feedback thank you  how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we dont sit for  minutes after an  hr flight fail  ok so what is being done about my experience my family had a terrible experience for  its kind of like being robbedexplain  great job losing one of my six bags on a direct flight  dont know how you manage to do it  the worst customer service in denver  ruined my day amp start trip sfo to gig both legs changed lost my paid upgrade amp  st class seat amp moved me from econ  to econ  now been on board with no movement for  minwow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse  have an employee at the gate min before boarding like u expect ur customers to be a competent company like ur rivals  no wonder the cabin is filthy badservice  and then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said not with my hands badservice  i need united to be a better airline  flight was cancelled flightled due to mechanical issues but when i ask for cab fare they say it was weather and cant help me  luckily i had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you youre welcome badservice  you really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard gross  help invest more in your planes and your people and less in stock buybacks and executive pay maybe then you would not disappoint  roc flight cancelled flightled love my snowy drive home with no useful substitutes  thats a crazy long form you need something other than a video  i hope not to see the same issue on my return flight tomorrow  flight just cancelled flightled this is ridiculous  you shouldnt page ohead that its best to call   on hold  mins  appreciate getting put on hold for min and then getting hung up on because i was requesting help for big group ill try delta  thank you for your reply  my frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait  list   or your staff could try not throwing the luggage around   of us are stranded   and flying from new orleans to huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days rather fly than wait  hello i am flying first class and am behind  people on zone   pls pass on to app dept  you should board st class first  cant get anyone to deal with me in person cowardly customer service i cant be looked in the eyes by anyone  nope called lost the seating preference i paid for and here i still sit well see what happens w my flight late flightr  stuck in dc trying to get to denver the engine shut down twice on us at the terminal got any available flights for me  yes  cancelled flightled moved to  ill figure out car rental changes and such  troubling news time to raise the bar on legroom   terrible travel experience traveled  miles roundtrip but two cancelled flightlations of short hops cost me two days  why are you charging people to

iad and cvg to iad both cancelled flightled by united but all other airlines operating friend stuck and now miss intl flight help  well if you dont want your customers to be frustrated compensate them appropriately when you screw up royally fakesincerity  employees are the angriest angstiest group of people anywhere except for tasha at checkin at iah   but its doubtful hell fly united again and he will be traveling a lot as a sales manager covering all of north america  worst customer nonservice for sure  worst airline ever  just let the employees know that good service and a kind attitude towards customers is vital in this kind of business thanks  need assistance line is out the door and travelling with  kids  friend at ohare and cant get on flight bc they say no proof he bought st class tkt he has boarding pass  right now at tropic air in san pedro belize line out the door all due to elected amp appointed hacks   your new mileage policy is awful before i might have paid slightly more for united because of miles now theres no difference  can anyone assure me that the aircraft coming to denver had left its previous destination flight   yes refund my ticket and give me email address to let u know what happened  i would like  speak  vp of custexp jimmy samartzis i sent a surveyemail about my awful flight exp   we are delayed in san pedro belize we are scheduled to

baggage claim in newarktiredandwanttogohome  usually your lounge staff are fantastic except today in mco where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling unitedfirst   hour delay misplaced bag poor communication and the worse unsympathetic confrontational gate agent not cool  why dont you respond to my emails of facebook msg im still wating for my tickets im getting really angry and

communication such a bummer thanks  great news that u wont refund tickets due to a bad exchange rate i knew u would come to your senses    how are you going to rectify this please direct me to your complaints department stickingtodelta  to top it all off your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight even when the lights were dimmed resulting in no sleep  it seems like no one from united can help me lots of fingers pointed zero people stepping up at least the gate has oreos  they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they  hr delay at the start huge queues at security no representative to meet us rude staff at baggage reclaim  inefficient  has the worst flight attendants they are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have everything has to be an argument  its

customerservice is non existent they dont have   another unfortunate case of bad luck usually maintenance issue they are now swapping planes to ont will get in late flight   its a shame the great customer service wasnt continued in sfo slightly absurd  onlyinamerica  days and not a word from unitedairlines customerservices bad pr guys  still awaiting a reply from ur customer services   days no response lousy unitedairlines  has happened on other airlines and theyve given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems  thanks im booked just spent an extra  hrs in the ten w no explanation now flying middle seat to char instead of memphis  agent rick clifton in seahou  told him my father is dying and needed to get my handbag on the cabin he did nothing shameful we all watched as the crew was escorted from the back to st class prebooked really   your dissatisfaction is und there were plenty of empty seats in coach  your dissatisfaction is understood crew members traveling for duty are prebooked on f  all good didnt die or anything as they say you get what you pay for  your staff at laguardia and lagos nigeria were unprofessional uncaring and not helpful ou  u kept passengers waiting all night  a plane that was being put out of service  leaving everyone stranded for night inexcusable  flt  lax to ewr your pilot bragged about getting to ewr early only to

not through your customer feedback  its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru  yes we are in ewr and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable  please review and fix your baggage procedures at dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline

can someone assist me with my dms waiting  hour on phone  hours on twitter  flight was overbooked was offered voucher to wait amp take another flight gate agent switched me over retracted voucher

flight flight today  if u miss first leg of ur flight you have to pay hundreds of s just to keep your second leg how much to keep my earned miles   from iad to buf  incredibly loud and like a third world s inner city metro bus  lowstandards    days for one flight and  for the other roundtrip  your overall experience of flying is not friendly  a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isnt delayed due to frozen water lines  annnnddddd im going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to   hour mechanical delaykilling me  every time i check a bag with your airline im confident i will be wearing the same clothes for  days  please prove me wrong  thanks united for the no running water and late flight flight from grand rapids to denver  kn not allowing me to bypass the receipt  on the refund request form never received receipt email charged   when will that happen it really confuses when the st content to come on the in screens is about how technology forward united is  you mean like my mailing address and rate by the surliness of my united coworkers im guessing our benefits arent great  i already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority im speechless at your system  just because you are a monopoly in  doesnt mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap  yeah bag is on the way as per usual

weather in iatanbul how can i make a reflight booking problems   it suggests that if cant confirm cert at time of flight booking problems i should assume that it may never clear didnt used to be that way   you dont really care about our comfort you care about profitability thats fine just own up to it unfriendlyskies   just be honest with your customers the new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane more rows  more money  missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool  designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space the article says the latter unfriendlyskies  what do you think missing meetings is worth  a flight voucher  i fly all the time so what would make it right  and  not to pile on but its time to update your in flight tv package    why is it so hard to add in meal preferences after i booked tickets i forgot to do it amp its now impossible i even called  learn to hold connections they texted me there is another flight

days to respond  yes i know that the question is why is that still the case fail  there are exitrow window shades in approx  of the windows  of your rjs lta frequent flyer   there is no excuse for leaving a minor to spend the night sobbing  hours in a plastic chair uas actions terrible  united  perhaps you could fix this  and this  answerthis  my wife and i will be sharing this dreadful experience dont pretend ua cares about young girl traveling alone  united airlines  jh going to process my refund for wifi its asking for a receipt  i never received an email you guys just whacked my credit card  dont post a link to an article that verifies the initial complaint with  comments saying the same thing   will breaking them in somehow make them longer so that they dont cut off the circulation in my legs unfriendlyskies  but why do people with no status get to buy an upgd at much less than cost ahead of premiers with earned confirmed certificates  worst agents in us at ft lauderdale airport passengers stand in line getting status alerts amp still didnt make an announcement  can we get any free upgrade because all the problems weve had our reservation is mkwlkr  this is with regard to a flight from a couple weeks ago im very frustrated with your policies amp expressing that  thanks for reaching out the seat was hard not enough cushion ok for short flight btw ua

day late flight with almost no sleep but here i feel sorry for the woman i consoled whos mother died during the night  disappointedunited did not feed small children on a  amp half hour flight

connection on ua tightconnection denver   delayed about  hours because of missed connections due to mechanical issues on st flight rebooked but please call me    you know your updates every  hours

checked in agent wouldnt tag my bags at am now im standing in line hell  we are never going to get to out gate at this rate  this is getting ridiculous now were missing our connection  couldnt use the confirmed upgd cert you gave me bc you decided to sell anyone a biz seat for  why do you bother giving them  i locked myself out of my account and needed access to book a flight  any chance you can troubleshoot check ins at   were at  minutes per person  how on earth could you close the united club in atlanta what a major fail at an airport of this size  lgaord ua  did not get agent name

lives in the stone age some people dont need computers make your site better for tablets and phones   what does dealing via email have anything to do with a crappy web form that is not made for mobile devices    next thing you know united will believe they are above the dot and take them to court united is anticonsumer    i read that last hashtag as go f united makes sense since they f us by cancelled flightling ticketed reservations   im sorry united isnt able to keep its word cuz their it is totally inadequate but they still says its a customer fault  how can you not know where my bags

regulation prohibits you being separated from your bagyet you lose our bag and thats okay  tried to check it  mins before a flight rather than  mins and we are stonewalled by your employees  do you

what the issue was and knowing you wont fix it   hour delay plus a jetway that wont move this biz traveler is never flying u again  my son is a passenger on flight  from chicago to toronto the plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped  yes it was the airport person who told me the bag was still in nashville when i filed the claim   ugh  my bags were sent to palm springs and not to lax as promised  they better be at the hotel when i get there  direct messaged you didnt hear anything back  yup it just happens way too often times in the last  months  so who does handle bag issues and why wouldnt you put me onto them in the first place  holiday of a lifetime to new york ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since sunday wontflyagainwithyou  my golf bag didnt have a top cover  staffers said they couldnt check without a type of cover or wrap forced to leave the bag  when will you offer real food in american clubs like the amazing food you offer in heathrow  once again my bag is lost when i travel united please do something  stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults any updates please this happened on way to newark and now again to lhr   flight  unfortunately this isnt an isolate flightd incident i havent waited less than min in years  did i mention one bag is an infant car seat amp weve been stuck with yr poor replacement on icy mtn roads  this is in ur hemispheres magazine im open to what will u do to make the flight more pleasant   hard to believe since your staff  sfo checked them under someone by the name of ritacomo who flew to ewr the same day  its late flight im tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight i wasnt chipper but i def was not rude  rude cust ser agents busy chatting then yelled bc i took pic put me stdby when seat diff agent gave me seat min late flightr platinum  i am a frequent user congrats u only lost my bags once in  years problem it was today and your staff were rude still no bag  yes though they have not located the bag yet it was a lovely flight outside of that  my wife has been on the phone several times for past  days with no result  so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public  unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit not for you to correct your atrocious customer service good to know  unitedairlines fill out form and never receive response i expect remedy we can travel another airline and cancelled flight as members w u  ewrlax ua my seatarmrest broken discover after takeoff flight fullfa filed report who to chat with for partial refund  so you told me to go knowing what the issue was only for me to go there and find out that you wont fix it  so i made it all the way to the airport and they say they wont fix the handle i showed you this problem and you said to go  then why do you bother responding your customer service is the worst never using you guys again  free hotel doesnt make up for such poor customer service and disregard  its messed up to refuse to wait  min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting  mechanical delay occurred in houston earlier today re their flight to ord  thx for checking in never got through via phone on hold over hour how long is too long to wait on hold ugh csfail  how else would i know it was denied  you allow shady rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer whos left holding the bag\\nflyunited  hours on the phonehung up onall i want is to be on a different flight same day that has an open seat greatservice  which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive    the cost of one of the round trip tickets  i cant go back to the airport im working and wont have time  are you telling me there is seriously no other way   to denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land  ive been doing this for  years and ive never had this many issues with any other airline  haha thats fine still wont fly  ever again seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else  note they are traveling w yr old unreal  and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport  roc u can make up  min in air but instead of waiting u leave early  mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ord only needed to wait  min for them refused and left early instead wtf  im on one of your  between jfk and laxwhen r u upgrading planesplane has no screenslousy seats and thats in unitedfirst  you already have vomit so you are halfway there  is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service   fair enough but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff  they held the flight for our group of nearly  people  you guys suck you delay flights but cant hold the connectors  minutes worstairlineever  time for a rantyou delayed my flight and still forgot my luggagethen delayed on the tarmac moments i love you united  it was an international flight and we didnt get our new eta until we were in the air   thanks for the rude customer service and  hour delay it really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings hello    useless response i need a functioning wheelchair not a customer care form to fill out   cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag reimburse   unbelievable hypocrisy  on top of this a csr went ahead and hung up on me after i called united to discuss this  now finally in memphis landed  minutes ago still no bags paying for a service that just gets worse  thanks for a terrible experience at ewr customers should be treated as a priority not as an inconvenience tryagain  the third wheelchair is broken   my flight was at  pm still at the airport gee what service  do they care nope  delayed until   very disappointed in cc purchased ticket online w voucher and charge full amnt would not hold price after refund unacceptable  exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card it does not state a passport must always be also presented read it i feel completely cheated  i read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there   \\n of your agents said we would be refunded agents said united should never have sold us the ticket  if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff  itproblems with the link thparty  i feel very well informed yes the flight is indeed delayed thank you   why do i pay more for coach plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me  can i get some help changing a ticket   minutes on hold and counting  was told by supervisor that united disconnected their customer support  so there was nobody to address it now igiveup  your mileageplus signup page is broken   for wifi just so i can tell my family im gonna be late flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours  fyi continuous texts and emails i am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful  so not only were you late flight you broke my luggage handle you paying for a new one   no friendly skies from you today hr weather delay in sfo followed by hr mechanical delay while sitting on plane nofun  once again your customer service rep was rude   i asked a question and in turn got attitude  jane was no help  disgusted again  can you not see the thread  poor old united never seem to get the response right   obviously the staff at ewr  united or otherwise have not seen your ads about  being friendly and helpful ewr worst airport  also why cant i preselect seats on sfogtyyz flight im a canadian flight booking problems on  hypocrisy rt   im sorry were not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for kp  i shouldnt have to spend my own  on a hotel because of a weather delay the weather being something completely out of my control   eventually  you should approach bags like   they get it  what if my nyc flight is delayed and i miss my connection to sacramento from chicago  said they would give us a refund  days late flightr no refund  how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for  hrs not convinced your company is safe for flt  we showed up to our flight several hours early tried to call amp was on hold  min bf call disconnected  if your policy changed you must advise at the time of purchase  same if you choose to vary it by airport  we want a full refund  wanted to but you cancelled flightled my tickets they were too special i guess even for united  im  for flight booking problems without major problems  isnt bad   dont check your baggage if you dont have to  they will lose it  im hoping we dont miss our lax  ito connection not looking forward to being stuck at lax overnight with our teamagain  well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated  we travel between canada amp usa on united with only nexus  how can you not know after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded the planes weight  you make it hard to fly with you delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around amp heading back to the gate connection   serious firing needs to happen at hnl they broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine   call customer service and of course they just say theres nothing we can do and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line  now submitted for the third time please check and confirm receipt have taken screen shots in case it disappears again thanks  if our already rescheduled flight is cancelled flightled is our hotel room paid for  classic  flight ua been sitting on tarmac for  mins with no report as to whyany input  a rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off excellent service united is offering  thanks for that advice so helpful cant believe you guys actually charge people to fly united  if you have had any issues with  united airlines please retweet paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead  just tried to log in and was told email log in not currently available   so why did you cancelled flight tickets for thousands of people when you didnt like the exchange rate doublestandards  so i wasted mins filling in  online forms you are telling me you didnt receive how do i know this wont happen this time  stuck here in iah waiting on flight  to honolulu for  hours due to maintenance issues could we have gotten a new plane fail    what kind of hypocrisy is that only cancelled flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage united  no the entire problem here is that i was never sent anything via email and only given a flight booking problems number over the phone  calling that number was useless heading to the

flight ua to denver for rmoug has been recheduled  times\\nif i am no show youll know why ridiculous  youre just using automated  responses and dont have the decency to actually carerespond  jt the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service  here i was thinking how i could say so many nice things after getting upgraded but then you delayed my flight its ok  i did dm the details back on  when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone  no claim number havent been back to iad baggage since is there a phone i can call to speak to someone  worst service ever   thanks for your attention i would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at dca what is my best option  cant believe united cant find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport loved united but debating choice  i am furious  youre firm is a disgrace despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter all alone at night  united  your website flight booking problems experience is an obnoxious upsellladen disaster for anyone with half a brain  flt  is having some major delays bc ground crew was so slow the flight crew has been terrific been  hours on the ground  sorry i hate united i wont get to see my family until thursday  your customer service for mileage plus customers is a disgrace i just spent  min on the phone to reset a pin number with no luck  all these changes way to stick it to your premiere k loyal customers why make things harder for those that loyal to you  thanks for the offer but i finally made it to my destination albeit hours late flight  airlines cancelled flights oc fll flight today  to switch no notice no apology we are done flying unitedairlines

and poor customer service everywhere ive flown now you take away the mileage programhorrible  youd learn if you listen to your customersyou do want you want asks their customer what they want  customer service   priceless united stranded my daughter at ohare united did zero to keep her safealone on a plastic chair for h  united air   which you finally cancelled flightled  what link those

appreciate the link nonetheless   hi jh my experience with united has been entirely disgusting but yes id like assistance in getting compensated for my bag  probably wouldnt be doing it had someone returned my call or email case number   i cant even fit my name on the first two lines yes please do pass on feedback this is a big downgrade from previous years  no it was  flight cancelled flightlations one due to weather one mechanical paid own hotel bag held in transfer no vouchercompensation  i got email that my reservations got cancelled flightled and i will be refunded  nothing got refunded as of yet  so what do you offer now that my flight was cancelled flighted and im stranded away from home and work  you are really trying me today  no they were to busy taking to each other and i needed to get to an audition  quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through  not really the service i was expecting  stuck in iad going on  hours waiting for a ferry flight from nashville that u cant tell when it will arrive ridiculous  flt  no gate agent no announcements so unprofessional time to go back to   flt  departure time has changed five times in the last  minutes why dont you figure out a solution and announce once  bags are still in houston since friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee  who can tell me where they are  flight  have already been cancelled flightled once been trying to get home two days staff being very unhelpful  each flight is worse than last flight attendants dont even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats  flight  agent now wandered off pilots came out looking for her went to charge her personal phone which shed been txting on  waiting for flight  to memphis incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay  of  rude  i dont see how i need to spend an extra  bc of ur equipment failure  i dont need to make any changes i reserved my seats when i bought my tickets and there was an error amp now there are no comp seats  its  and no power outlets at the seats on a  hour flight to california seriously this is why airlines are failing pathetic  thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so i didnt miss my transfer   could you please send me a phone  to the refunds department  we have submitted our claim through email without success  im not this person but ive been sitting in denver for three hours and all i want to do is get on a plane please let me go home   flight  on  was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up  i just need to get to ric tonight ive been in ewr for hrs now  which is why my next flights to miami will be on another airline  it is super frustrating that the folks at the united ticket counter in pittsburg arent honoring their own media rate unitedfail   minutes after arrival and no bags for most people ua from den to ewr how long should we wait until a ual rep comes here  with karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called united at the time amp told she could board but karen would not accept  she has crossed  prior times with other carriers and no issue karen was rude untrained and unhelpful i also spoke  nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air car or boat she can travel with only nexus   employee yelled at her  employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter   refused boarding with nexus nexus confirmed she should not be refused  u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee does that make sense to you and yes i already called cust svc they said no  yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston i hate little planes  the refund request functionality on  is brokeni get a time out error   only at newark can you land  minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate  giving up on your direct flight from iah to honolulu rd attempt in  years  rd delay   meal voucher wow customer service  nearly  hours late flightr and still no idea where it is i will never fly united again if i can help it   had wifi broken on plane had same outage on  on friday how can southwest get it right on every plane but united cant  second day amp attempt trying to leave iad amp im on another plane delayed for mechanical issues over an hour delayed  when is my plane coming  been delayed for almost  hours no plane  not fast enough  no excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft southwest has wifi this is awful  my mothers flight was delayed from phlord were on our way to nrt and the gate refused to upgrade a platinum  blegh  is late flight again  everyone braved the weather and  passengers are waiting for a flight crew  really  miserable trip  lost bag sat found mon lost again shipping nd day ground tues might have it for return flight home  spending the afternoon  mia not your fault  no lounge very inconvenient  costumer service sucks waiting for a week for a response  i somehow think im going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in denver without winter clothes on my dime  i guess well see  of course i need help  ive been dming you ladies and gents all day your only solution is hope for the best and lax  i was denied use of a rear facing car seat on ua an erj can you confirm the actual policy  you better hold my flight to tucson  just landed in houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem  dropped off a luggage at iad over  months ago for repair from damages havent heard anything about it since when do i get it back  feck guys stop cancelled flightling flights from ewr to ric the weather is fine i both locations  step  cancelled flight flight step  dont notify customer step  charge them for food while they try to survive their wait brilliant   besides no small degree of selfinterest we take that route several times a year amp would hate to be in that situation  we rebooked but  and i had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours frustrating   thats the gist of what the flight attendant told her  btw is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation   what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant who put the responsibility squarely back on passengers shoulders   no but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business  sat at airport for  hrs still sitting at gate  sigh  gold star for united change my flight miss all connections but cant accommodate me until a much late flightr arrival timenot happy s firstclass cockup\\n  did not let me get on the iahhnl direct now weather delay for my sfo leg stop being reactive and be proactive  bad coffee but the juice is ok getphilz  united terminal sfo airport   why am i mot getting my refund  nothing apparently ive flown w you  times in last  weeks and  of those experiences incl today were clusterfucks  didnt get her name she was not in our group she was sitting behind us think it was window seat  we only overheard  you know what the united club needs power moar power insufficient outlets for the roadwarrior ord  thrilled to have my carryon checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when i boarded last  what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business employeerelations   ridiculous to fly outdated s anywhere much less btwn iah and sfo no power ports no  wifi no personal entertainment torture  last night we waited forever at the gate because someone from corporate dispatch forgot to call the crew unfriendlyskies  broken entertainment system on my  hour nyc flight terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form wont work hopeless  call my work and tell them its your fault im late flight  is officially the worst most delayed and least helpful airline i have ever had the misfortune of flying on  i have items of sentimental value that im heartbroken are missing  still waiting for a reply  please see a flight attendant for what why isnt there enough room for over head bags i carry on to save time wanted to get my bag benefit but instead get  pricing on all three tickets when adding a card mp visa is only option   i tried  dm it would not go thru not sure why  link to current status of flightsairports fly bwiewrmco this morning yet cant yet tell what any problems are except see snow  i like delays less than you because im the one on the plane connect me with a voucher  and dont hope for me having a nicer flight some other time try to do things right you sold me those tickets with that connetion  the we got into the gate at iah on time and have given our seats and closed the flight if you know people is arriving have to wait  yes we waited in line for almost an hour to do so some passengers just left not wanting to wait past am  still waiting just hit one hour  although im not happy you cancelled flighted my flight home tomorrow phx to atl then dca i am happy on how easy it was to rebook  hello  been on hold

tweet this is so easy to fix  my wife had been in group a in prev flight but got bumped for some reason  alone with two kids at least put her in group a  my flight was delayed  hrs im  months pregnant amp supposed to be caring for my mom whose in surgery now very upset  been on hold  min so far trying to book seat for my infant price increased  in meantime what do i do  poor performance all around

traveling with  month old and having to wait outside in  degree  they were moved to the pm flight  main concern now is luggage arriving with them they were told that sw was having   got my bags  hours late flightr and an offer of  to go pick them up taxi costs  one way spent  for the inconvenience  thx but ill be expecting a credit for this leg   appreciate yall getting the gate issue figured grr plenty open gates yet we sit and wait on tarmac   minutes on hold waiting is ridiculous  have u seen any of the messages the past hour   went to purchase a flight that i began processing not even

customer relations can extend the expiration date of my unused travel funds   over two hours now  ugh we should all get vouchers this is inexcusable esp after a pre flight check that was ok  horrible experience passenger of size was  in my seat offered  voucher for this by christine c   yes very much so i was looking forward to using your airlines for future flights but never again  need to learn how to treat people with respect and just a little dignity fail  redeempoints packages magically gone by time we finally got through   felt like baitandswitch  i think i get a faster response on

time this winter  kudos to bag handler at dtw gate  at  pm ran to keep bags from hitting ground in  degree temp   when i called i was told my bag had made it to phl but still has not been delivered or

tweet through the weekend bad weather but closes down customer relations center to process refunds for cancelled flighted flights  stop cancelled flighting my flight i have us history tests to take and chemistry things to learn do you not understand  been all up and down the area where the pic was taken and dont see any albums  my question is this whats up with the crazy boarding procedure does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats  prove it cuz the southwest people here dont even know why its behind schedule  u were bae until u lost both of my bags and had no clue where they were or what happened to them for  hours   prove it  thinks that a  voucher makes up for spending  hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from really  the problem is apologies dont help results matter and its proving impossible to find anyone who is interested in that  is new mkt strategy to be average like all the rest whathappend rr points devalued again   do these scavenger hunt  locations have anything in common because im playing detective trying to figure out the one for atl  ruined my sunday  hours of delays out of dia now my bags are at the wrong airport  to deliver them insult to injury  sent looking for that functionality in your app though should be a one click action  like kelsey said really bad spot for locals do you know how long it takes to find parking then walking over to the bellagio  how about destinationdragon tix for tonite for the inconvenience since i am not there to play scavenger hunt  right were delayed so im crabby  also why do you allow one family member to purchase earlybird check in and hold rows   people pre boarded\\nonly  needed a wheel chair off the plane was not the case boarding   poor customer service displayed over the weekend during the storm i was stuck on the tarmac for  hours with no answer  feeling very frustrated that i bought wifi onboard and cant load an email  why do you let one person board with early bird and save seats for entire party notcool flight  but when do i get my gin amp tonic   is this a sick joke toyingwithouremotions   please explain to me why every other flight to dallas is going out today except the  pm  will continue to be my airline of choice  most frustrating travel day ive experienced  delays and  gate changes   serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle  but for real you should fire   i appreciate the response but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least toughtomakeplans  how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink gettingthirsty  i can doesnt it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats we should need to fit in them  just wanted  change an anytime flight leaving at    phone hold  mins phone answers she says sorry  no dice  werent too sincere when you cancelled flighted my flight and made me drive  hours to get home  pretty terrible customer service sat on

youve completely lost me as a customer unless my bag is back to me  i got the call from rdu that my baggage is there except that doesnt help me bc i cant get it until im flying back home  for example cant pay  hotel amp food or transport to alternate city we are flying from or give clear record of alt flight  tough i can take zero meaningful assistance while stranded for  days is another matter looking for signs you care abt cust  dont apologize do something about it words mean nothing actions work eom  after an hour and a half then it came back damaged not happy   why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information  but to make us tru to find space in other flights  this customer service is as bad as   no delay i pay  for bs a ticket you boarded flight early im last to board now have middle seat wasted   first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not cancelled flight it earlier then very amateurish that there was no plan  very disappointed in your handling of tonights cancelled flighted dallas flight  not that it was cancelled flighted but no contingencies  please start flying to huntsville so i never have to fly american airlines again  no you

southwest from the beginning but very unhappy about your devaluation   longer flights with  series no wifi will be great when you retire them  excruciatingly slow internet on swa flights is now the norm rather than the exception is this being addressed  the inbrowser hover over is intrusive and annoying and the fact that the wifi only works on one device is sort of sad  the sign in screen had major mobile issues the responsive design wasnt working properly my nexus   sure did also read on there that southwest doesnt believe it is liable for the incident how is it my fault that sw lost it  whats up with the new inflight wifi service super crappy user experience miss the old provider   its too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat  repeating this is policy is basically repeating fuck you to your customers ill be shopping for a new airline asap  yeah thats not what happened im really pissed this is the kind of thing i expect from us or austrian not you   glad to see you know how to keep the money in your own pockets thanks for the voucher in return for lost bag  you call this customer service sitting in the tarmack for hr lost bag and you give me a  voucher

another airport at a different time but delayed again  i willmake sure to tell everyone i know about this all around horrible experience i will also post it on my business page  and currently as im bringing my  year old to the bathroom im being rushed by the flight attendant  not terribly inspired to call customer service in the future now  also they said they couldnt even book the flight they

plenty of ways u could have gotten us on that flight badcustomerservice  absolutely the missed connection caused us to miss our ferry to vieques get us to vieques also flight vouchers prbound  why do this to me sending njb to uvf today and its a weekday why not a weekend   ive experienced better service making connecting flight from  and  badcustomerservice jfk pr  service getting worse and worse plane cant fly waiting on a nd aircraft so much for planning  no seat assignment  mins before a flightline  people deep guess im sitting with the baggage   the worst flying experience ive ever suffered through id appreciate my money back  my wife sent me a family invite but i never accepted it she should not be locked into a family account that never got created  i spent an hour on the phone with customer service only to find out that they cant help need help with family pooling asap  customer service says since my wife setup a family account that she now cant join mine for a year  help me fix please  full to capacity i also pid extra for these seats perhaps the crew could be more helpful  we have twice they said they cant dim those lights but they did on our first flight  jfk nyc staff is amazing the lax jetblue sending an email with details but it was a disappointing experience   you can do better than this and you can do better for me and all the passengers flight jfk to pwm  we would have been up in the air by now now our new plane weve been redirected to has mechanical errors aka more delays   you delay all my flights then you redirect my gate then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have    definitely no note from whoever stole from me  but the  hour policy when i called and they said i didnt report it soon enough what would have changed if i had noticed sooner   hopefully that will help someone in the future would there have been a different procedure if i had discovered the theft sooner   i did that as soon as i realized will they try to figure out who is stealing from peoples bags security cameras anything   i did but since i was stranded in syr without a ride i missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter  hours  absolutely no worries im just never flying with you again ever even i have to hitch hike cross country passengersarepeople  dont lose my luggage  you just directed me to your mobile website where is the direct link get it together  if i had made as many mistakes as you in as short a period of time i would i have lost my job at this point  i understand why ur doing it but for someone who just traveled  hours to get here early relax b flight etc adv notice maybe  not one of my four flights this trip has been on time what the hell is your companies problem   mco to lag two hour delay

early too bad were at  minutes and counting waiting for our bags  i believe its irina on the flipside super disappointed that eatup cafe isnt available on this bos gt sfo flight today  all good i just have  remind myself that if this was  i might be on a horse amp buggy so whats a little delay right  unhappy with  hour delayed flight missed dinner   called jb  timeseverytime auto vmsgyour wait time should not be longer than  mins waited longer than  mins and no answer  all correct for rates boston to pittsburgh wknd march  rates all of a sudden took off made plans came back to buy amp surprised  nope the regular line was multix faster you literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as ems  thank you but that isnt really responding to my request is it you are sending me into a generic environment on your site  i would like to communicate directly with a customer experience executive does joanna geraghty have an email address  understood but i watched as fam heading to fl was expedited when they had m to takeoff i am speaking at conference in sf   any effort to fix your points system  days and a call to customer service and still no account update chasing points is no fun  i tried had me running from curbside to selfcheck amp wasting even more time ended up flight booking problems united for  am so upset  keeps getting better no water on the plane  i dont want jetblue tv i want jetblue wifi   what is the deal with flt  today departure keeps changing when is it going why is it so late flight  lol at your estimated departure time plane hasnt even started boarding yet you cant even get your delays right   you know how i love you jb but honestly when you have complex feedback those pulldown suboption formsmaddening  said they havent started looking for it gave me a  limit in nyc at the waldorf astoria and cant find  outfit   yeah im aware of that hence my original msg to you   just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal airline is a disaster  no i asked either way it doesnt make the flight less delayed  yes i filed yesterday around noon i have a claim number but they havent contacted me yet  shocker my flight delayed an hour thanks for reminding me why i switched to delta  as courtesy to mosaic members or anyone a request for water should be attended promptly daniel in flight  should know better  are you having any issues with online checkin my colleague and i are getting webpage not available after submitting online form  are going to let fl into a gate in bos any time soon were just sittin here on the tarmac  waiting  not an issue but i think training amp information would help great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better  rats thats a bummer  is so sloooooow today  terrible landing on   flight was two days ago flight  from pos  woo update flight  is now possibly delayed by more than hrs  power of positive thinking people  appreciate the response but already spoke to a mco and their response was there is nothing we can do idk if thats what you mean  didnt find out my flight for ny scheduled to leave at pm is delayed by more than hrs until after checking in huge fail  vegas desk said jfk connect would b held  us and  others on our plane now staff at jfk says weather was problem epicfail  other jfk to boston flights went off with some delay but not this  epicfail   wtf stuck at jfk for  hrs in a delay to boston cuz u say snow  no snow on weather map  wtf   words staff training what a joke  is a joke missed my connecting flight by  minutes last flight of the day and they dont hold it   minutes  any idea whats going on at terminal five at jfk seems to be zero traffic movement  very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept i nearly had to beg get just for a courtesy report  apparently the plane was delayed coming up from san juan monsoon there today  over  hour delay going from nyc to denver come on man    no oscars on direct tv on this flight we were so looking forward to it we were devastated    fix your amp jet bridges   minute delay nd gatestill waiting  jetblues   didnt work flyfi plus couldnt access abc app so i spent  and still missed oscars disappointed   i think ill come take a nap at the terminal    safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not   from jfk to las still delayed  the lack of tv made it rough thats literally why i picked yall over the competitors  but not reddit i work for the site and this is ridiculous  i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimi why dont you guys go to maimi  aka take stuff out of the checked bag then just carry on the extra weight for someone just had shoulder surgery thats just no  can you take  off your blacklist trying to work   goodwill now at    x   fine   still want your new ceo to make a public apology to all passengers of flight   thank you hopefully its soon we are supposed to leave at   hard when youre with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane we should get better than this  had a potentially stressful situation in reflight booking problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome  even tho the extra  lbs are still going on the plane just as a carry on where is the sense what do you say to fat people  i thought being a mosaic member had perks the best part is instead of checking the extra lbs im carrying it on   are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days you went from  to  for overweight fees outrageous   if only the show was on the flight  no abc  oh well  ill live  nexttime andthewinneris  ill call in the morning too upset right now  im still waiting no answer  the amount of money i spent on hotels for a week bc of flight cancelled flightlation another flight doesnt make up for the money lost  being told jfk had a  hour delay this am which is reason for my delay now it cant be that hard to notify with  hours notice  by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk keep waiting time does not cost anything for  hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback   thanks so the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather relate flightd problems  i am less concerned about the delay than i am about not being notified until i looked at the board that my flight was delayed  after boarding flight  the captain informs that he could exceed the hrs regulation and turned the plane around incredible   considering accessibility is an absolute must equality  how do we watch the oscars though right now no abc on flight  missingtheoscars  ooookay  thats silly of you guess were watching the oscars purely on twitter reactions tonight oscars  ive heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept only apple pay i thought that was impossible amp certainly not emv compliant  nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster last time i wasnt allowed to fly stndby now a  hour delay wout notification  oh right me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in sdq   a bunch of flights are delayed from ffl to northeast destinations no announcements at the gate whats going on  im dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight  in santo domingo have been treated hrs to board the plane and no info given   i did  they have no idea where it is  thanks but still annoying especially if i miss my flight  can i tweet at the tsa  hey jetblue  still waiting to hear where you lost my  surfboard between jfk and bqn airports  your gif game is strong  well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility   flight  den to jfk already hrs delayed any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc  why close prechk at pm on a sunday at jfk  annoying  your crew didnt say it was about safety if they say that i was glad to stay  check the information you give to the costumers  you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in south florida bc of your disorganization getittogether  im going to write a post on  about the experience your customer service has tanked jetblue  still no response from ceo i guess he is at the oscars  i bet his flight was on time  justwrong  okay names of sj crew are alamo tatiana keep telling me to hold then leave desk ali told me he couldnt help bc going on break  that is a stock response delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv amp being told by  ppl to wait amp theyd come back but did not   hr delay on flight to jfk via tampa amp worst customer service in san juan airport this after app not working all day  just please get my luggage from  onto carousel   logan airport and ill be able to go home  what happens when i have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for even more space upgrades  thanks for the response just been waiting for  hours and really frustrated seems like no one at jetblue is concerned  tx for the info just dont understand why you couldnt accurately estimate departure time earlier weather in ny is fine now  update please on why flight  continues to be further delayed  thank you for not even coming with a solution great service i might sayas a trueblue member i am totally dissatisfiedthanks  all day  how about free wifi on flt  out of pbi to make up for  hr delay treat us right  why is flight  delayed out to ny same problem  thanks for the update preciate it hope it gets here been delayed  days getting back  yes they are working on it hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home  wellmy paid tickets have no assigned seats at all so essentially i wont be on this flight unless i pay more  if seats arent guaranteed why do we pay for them when i called the rep said some other people booked our seats  yes please get me the seats we paid for  flight  departs  am  finally  arrived jfk with no psgrs at  pm  thats a long flight aka bus   i hope your customer service reps are as reliablefriendly as they usually are so far you are not living up to your  repexper fyi  the last email response  we undrstnd this wasnt best  you but hope  wlcm u back onbrd n the future   nice touch lol  last flight was cancelled flightled then it was  hours to change a light bulb now sitting here waiting for maintenance unreal  i have to say that jetblue has officially lost a customer what a waste of all the points i have too i am yet to be in a flight   i will keep on tweeting until your ceo answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight  just wrong  i think its safe to say that after  years of loyal jetblue flying we are officially done byebyejetblue  token  goodwill voucher for passengers stuck on flight  from phoenix today  hour mark how about a  per passenger  anything serious i should worry about  why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you  jetbluefail   seriously what is your solution who exactly will help my  year old if theres a problem with the plane   your scheduling skills failed the delay went from four hours to nearly six dont tell me you were snowbound in pbi  sadly no i have the app but it also is experiencing difficulties the flight information boards are keeping me updated  this is absurd should a stranger help my kids if theres a problem jetblue   thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel when bag missed connection sfo customerservicenot  youre lucky were still flying you after todays landing gear failure get your act together and help us sit with our kids  so the prefference option is not something that you honor so why having it as one of the services if not applied  if you want to be helpful find us a seat dont quote terms and conditions jetbluefail  do you really think its okay to sit kids away from parents srsly esp after your landing gear failure   they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids your terms response is insulting  jetblue  whats your excuse this time for  delay from lga to tpa i know the plane is in the air  if you cant guarantee parents will sit with their children dont sell tickets with that promise jetblue   once you go blue you dont go back  why are there so many delays to north east cities  kids fly dont hire people who dont care about them this guy jetblue   i shouldnt be made to feel like a criminal because i want to sit near my  year old on a flight jetblue   usually i have such a great experience with you guys very very unhappy with you right now  why would you hire a guy who doesnt care about the safety of children not remotely acceptable   whats up three delays so far resulting in over three hours of unnecessary extra waiting  never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids but this guy is willing to do it jetblue   from san diego with a  hour delay to jfkeven you have a amex  jetblue even having over  travel miles youre still nothing  it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a  year old alone is considered okay but this guy thinks so   third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys this will be my last trip with you  youve let me down  delay at jfk because of inbound flight from syracuse really ishouldhavedriven  a  year old cant sit alone on a flight this is absurd and this guy is a dick jetblue   being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our  and  year old on the flight jetblue   thanks for not sending me an update that our flight was delayed  hours unbelievable   hours delayed now in hour increments  really  amp as mosaic i still have to pay  to use lounge during this waste of a sunday  no i havent done that yet is that something i can do online thx   no wifi on this flight so we cant tweet you our oscar party pics at ft bluecarpet  seabos  thank you for the reply wouldve appreciated communication before checking in about the delay jetblue used to be my goto  you also promised to change my wifes name on the account and it is also not done  wtf  you guys really suck i just spent  minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account  they are still not there   where is it coming from i thought tampa  good perspective if only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before i arrived at the airport communicationiskey  exactly why is my flight delayed  bdl to dca cant seem to get an answer  flight from bos  rsw tomorrow all i need is my wife  yr old to sit together but no option when checking in  you left  people on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to jfk because of   at what point in delays can i take a different flight to my destination  you just dont get it  its not about the money its about people how about a public apology from the president of jet blue  why when you book a flight now does jetblue separate a yr old from the mother isnt that a bit stupid checkin headaches  does not fit in   you never got my wife to her destination and you expect a  goodwill credit will  make everything hunkydory you blew it  every time i look at the flight status  more minutes is added to the delay how about some points for trouble  hey awesome peeps whats up with flight  from boston delayed hrs  flights  and  i have picked up twice this week for  and both times it was delayed   whats up with delays to and from boston today my sister is trying to go home and broinlaw trying to come to rdu craziness   to boston still sitting  now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be mins into hrs  i waited  hrs for my bags and my flight was only  hrs  should i bother contacting them i already checked into my flight   backlog is an hour at most this is over two  unacceptable  your agent told us tsa didnt have a crew to get bags  no baggage crew update  your staff is incompetent with no answers after  hours  is blaming  for flight  luggage debacle  luggagegate  yoga it is tv service seems to be down though \\ni look forward to that do much  you failed thats the answer please dont justify otherwise  come on already delayed  hrs on flight  as we waited for the pilot to come from boston now you reassign him endless trip  when i got your alert i immediately started looking to rebook but we only had  minutes from reflight booking problems to catch a flight to srq  still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row   i shouldnt have to find them they should tell us ive flown jet blue since your first month the experience isnt what it was  if my flight was delayed can i show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do i have to go on time  im over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey  if that was the case why did your alert arrive so late flight fourhour delay dont buy it  our flight out no tv now our flight back not seated together b  maybe our fault still no fun  i dont believe so thats not what the team has told us  also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a  hour international flight   out of jfk no one has info amp no answers as to why we boarded the plane the team is in an awkward spot amp everyone is cranky   flight  is still waiting for bags most of us checked in  hours ago people are missing connections  please help  something to think about when you are dealing with people  just wrong  no excuses figure it out amp expect the unexpected  i understand but wish you would have announced the delay  hours earlier vs sitting for  hrs at mco  what gives delayed over  hours at mco to jfk every time  my wife was with our dog  they wouldnt even let her out off the plane  my daughter was at newburgh lives close by so wrong  according to your ground staff it hasnt even been taken off the plane yet  thanks for making an effort credit where credit is due flight  delayed  hours instead of  hours fwiw loweredexpectations  at what time  all these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over  hours just wrong  flight delayed at jfk  hours then  hours then  hours now its back to  hours with no explanation or apology  flight  had a   hour weather delay but what is the  minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers  hrs on tarmac yest b cancelled flight today  hr delay why not send txtemail re jfk closed amp saved all trip  sit  again  flying out of buf  bos missing captain really delayed til  not happy  it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed  i know but i wanted to pass it along not good for the t experience esp for someone who flies  times a month  so what about the plane stuck in newburgh wont start  it that weather relate flightd as well  these passengers on plane for  hrs  thanks home to msy tsa precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude one grabbed and pushed children  your hold music sucks  jfk t north check in  bag drop ladies  has been checking in someone for the entire time another doing check ins too  no excuse though for  gate changes though  if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed that would have helped  get me home flight  from buf to bos is missing a captain really  nope this am flight is now not leaving until almost pm  i cant believe i paid money for this   the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update way to go hopeless   will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time  this is ridiculous we are on  hours coming up of waiting to deplane there are are newborns on board  waiting at hpn on plane more than an hour since landing bc of no gate please get us off this plane  too late flight several passengers are inebriated youre in league with big alcohol shame on you  thanks for making my vacation not worth it again currently waiting on the runway for another hour to deplane  letting me down in san fran no media rate whats the deal looks like this is the last time i fly anywhere with you  and have empty help desks  there was a closure people here need to inform passengers not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re updated departures  according to jfk plenty of planes are landing no problem there  thanks for the third gate change   flight  jfk to cartagena all at this airport bar singing the opposite of your praises were making a pact to never fly u again  what happened to our plane meant to leave   why do we have to wait for  from buffalo seems organizational error not weather  where is the award winning service  really not acceptable just informed plane wont start chartering bus to take passengers to jfk  how much longer to jfk opens i am a diabetic and i need sugar plane dont have nothing  flight  now sent back to the gate even though the app says

family vacation using trvl credit on phone w new rep now who is being very helpful  its sunny and gorgeous in ny actually whats the real reason  its been  hours why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight  at jfk this is absolutely ridiculous  still sitting in plane in newburg this is getting ridiculous no way to treat loyal customers  whats the delay if the system isnt down  dont think any rly knows whats goin on supposed  leave at a then a then a then a then a then a now   that is not very gracious of  to tell me where i can go buy water or a snack when our flight is delayed over  hours  after applying my new tag she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belti had to walk back  yards  get flight  into the air  thats not weather relate flightd  you are just being nice and blaming the weather  airport just wasnt prepared investigation time  then this agent demanded i remove my old luggage tag every other airport the jb agent politely handles it  im also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue alot  its not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app just give us an honest estimate  she waved someone behind me to step forward although i explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight   flight  is departing before we even board  heres part was at bag drop inserted my jetblue cc didnt print pass agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass  thats not what i heard weather was fine this morning flight  was circling for some timesomeone forgot to clean the runway  when its  mins past scheduled time w no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as on time updateyourwebsite   how can your entire system go down no it really  appreciate the heads up at  that my am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in boston communicationfail dobetterjetblue  seriously system down no it  just had a horrible experience with check in agent at fort myers ill document and send details off to boston  flt to carta what is goin on st told plane coming from hangar then gate change now no one knows wat plane were getting on  isnt this something you should do  why should i tell your crew how to do their job  your app needs updating says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with hr delay   are there airportwide delays at bos or did we just get unlucky

for business twice a week and after the  fiasco ill be flying blue more often thanks  wont see my money again after their poor service    should have stuck with virgin america what was i thinking

stuck    oh wow and im complaining about two hour on the run way shucks jetblue not good your service was better than this  im curious to know how do you compensate for passengers missing engagements

bdl to dca flights yesterday and today why is every single one getting delayed  basically stole my glasses and now i cant drive or see in my classes and theyre not answering my phone calls thanksjetblue  weve been delayed for almost  hrs i take jetblue because ive had good luck but today is really frustrating  something theyre not telling us   weve been on the runway for over an hour now the water pressure is low and taxiing back for maintenance   thanks for the heads up about the  hour delay sarcasm patienceiswearingthin woof  when i sign in into trueblue why do i have to do it twice happens to everyone around me  mechanical failure isnt boston fault   to boston  im going to miss a hugely important meeting because of your constant delays itscostingmeincome  when your flights delayed gtgtgt  sorry to report we are stuck on tarmac being held so notwheelsup i was a bit steamed in conjunction wmy new hour wait at first but having sat down and bought a bit of tea ive settled some   appreciate what youve done on your end to make this right but still unhappy with initial incident will be calling lines may be extra long or security slow but seems your employees too quick to blame customers who dont arrive  hours ahead   this is the error message paper tickets cannot be serviced online\\nplease see a jetblue crewmember for assistance  ccndjp i can send a screen shot of the systems error if an email address is provided  inconvenience is an understatement more like torture clearly going down the wrong path jetblue  dont just cling on to the safety card it safety was really an issue then flight would have landed immediately   i waited in line all that time to be told by a crewmember that theres no update until  hrdelay disappointed    phone agents cant see same flights i see online  cant change tickets even when i am paying very frustrating jetblue  why was flight  forced to return to ny when there was a malfunction why not land in the countless air strips surrounding chi  denverboston  flight   and bostondenver  flight  both planes visible snack crumbs on seats on all upon boarding  felt a bit like they were adding insult to injury since well be in terminal  for seven hours until the next flight   i knew the  hours sounded odd missed a flight we hit jfk an hour early for and your gate  attendant told us    well being on time is not going to happen now safety does come at looks like ill have  look  another flight now sttimeflyer  u said mins to take off and now we were told hr more delay amp possible cancelled flightlation how do u plan to rectify this frustrated  i hope so wanted an early flight to avoid the airport chaos but its too late flight for that  no updates on anything all we know is there is an issue with the front wheels being locked  flight  to dca  delays im all for erring on the side of safety but its an inconvenience to people with connecting flights  its ok things happen just very frustrated when you have to change your schedule see you tomorrow for a new rescheduled flight  i had a sjc to jfk departing pm tonight i have to now change my whole schedule can we get a sort of refund for this  your airline should have a better system to inform your clients when their flights are cancelled flightled last min  we have schedules too  the slowest boarding process ive ever experienced and rude customer service agents  needs to get its act together in phx   yes best case scenario i get my gear late flight friday early saturday camp starts at am tomorrow toolittletoolate flight   in ca for the weekend to attend a training camp thanks for sending all my gear to fl looks like this trip is a waste nothappy  why are you making me stay in jfk until  am or late flightr just let me rebook without making me pay more  and stranded passengers arent being helped to get another flight  why did you just cancelled flight flight  last minute  im sitting on the plane too many predictable mechanical problems  still onboard this is getting bad  on your  flight jfk to pr they got the doors open on this frigid temperature icyflight  poorservice poorcommunication waitingsince  for bags frm flight  jetblue  bags hv been posted on board for flight on carsl  now switched to carsl  its comedic watching passengers run frm  to othr  the one man in baggage office says i dunno help  where is our luggage flight  has been waiting an hour for bags jetblue poorservice  what is going on we arrived at pm not one bag has been unloaded flight   service for baggage at jfk is incomprehensible no employee knows where our luggage is frm flight  lax to nyc its an hr wait now  yes of course before i left the airport i kept looking but claim is still open   stewardesses cant work wo a galley light back to nyc to change a light fromthefrontseat jetblueblues    why do you have every channel but  how are  and i supposed to watch scandal but free flyfi is sweet  i left my apt hrs ago to go from boston to sjc and im still nyc please bring back the nonstop flight jetblueblues  what is going on with the flight from buffalo to jfk have they figured anything out about the temperature and the tower yet  we never received that  credit for inoperable tvs on our sfo gt jfk flight  weeks ago never got an email  the pilot just stated that after  years of flying he has never experienced anything like this gettingoffplane  we now have to get off of the plane and wait another  hours for someone at the  to read the temp tired  i appreciate the quick response but how can no one go outside to check temp so we can leave in buf currentlysittingontarmac  after  mins they tell us they cant check temperature for at least  more hours so its back to the gate to wait mosiacfail  time to reevaluate my nyc carrier  whats going on with flight  and how many free trips will i get from this epic inconvenience    the departure time keeps getting late flightr  ill be lucky if im home by am  how come youre responding to everyone else and not me wtf   what a patronizing response to a legitimate issue  yep  hour at logan gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane they just arrived passengers request butt massages  i love your flights but theres always some delay unfortunately  my butt hurts  thats what they told me half an hour ago  i have been hanging here for almost an hour  took forever for catering to get to my flight now are very delayed so ticked off right now  it is absurd that i have waited more than mins because the flight attendant assigned for my flight is late flight you dont have others  delayed flight bummer  well were on our way now but more than half my tv channels are just static   what is happening with the flight from fll to sfo why the delay and the reroute  shut up an turn on the tvsmusic  if your confirming to me that the rate wont go down again looks like i cant fly jetblue this time around cant afford that price   he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight didnt feel safe  been a member since  looking to travel next week  couldnt book right away due to all the snow im in bos  i dont want to seem crazy have already asked twice  sent an email more than  hours ago asking a few questions still no response need answers before hopefully flight booking problems flight  all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues im looking for something a little more specific  if im about to get on a plane i think i deserve to know what the mechanical issues are for the flight being delayed  can you give me an update on flight  mcogtjfk theyre saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are  walked from the gate to the just ask desk by gate    on flight  to orlandoridiculous that we had to wait for this high school band to board notbabysitters whrsthecoach  you service agents at mco are great but their are not enough of them working right now  not to get into semantics here but by means within the extent or period of during and it is still technically  dictionary  is giving me false hope of ever getting home  not cool to announce a flight delay when everyone is checking in a  hour delay bdldca with a staff offering  no help  whats the hold up with flight  boarding shouldve taken place  minutes ago  now we are waiting over an half hr for the packages whats wrong with you guys   do your trueblue pages not work on chrome or safari i keep getting blank pages when i lick on the trueblue tab on your site  that is my point they are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they cancelled flightled  i can probably find some of them are the ticket s on there  no they offered the flight  i paid then they changed itthis is the nd  time you have done this to me ruins cruise plans  i cant do that flight i need a late flightr one i need you to change my flight you guys changed it and now i cant do that time  my bag is missing from

bag you were supposed to give it to disneys magical express this ami am livid  flight  ha  one employee said they were reassigned another said they just left i just want some warm weather  i want to add my flight to mexico was on air canada same exact situation but with none of the problems ive had with jet blue  you mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesnt have email or telephones right  capital one and i explained the false fraud alert why did the jet blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasnt resolved  no it didnt all work out i called jet blue from mexico to address the fraud alert with capital one on the line rebooked  actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone  i called jet blue to get an explanation and make sure it would not happen in the future i was told to write the fraud dept  when i arrived at the airport i was told my ticket had been refunded because my name had a fraud alert  but jet blue had cancelled flighted my ticket amp never reissued it  has screwed me over for the last time   glad to give you my business jetscrew awfulcustomerservice  alternatives  you have absolutely no respect for loyal customers   years  no more  im done  pooling and gifting are completely different  i shouldnt have to be charged  to send points  its disgusting  why would you charge money to transfer points to someone  doesnt help if i have to fly on specific days  its noting about me i m perfectly fine its the attitude and dealings with flyers stubborn demanding unwilling to accommodate  i am sharing it to the public i fly  times a year and sitting now on the tarmac in fll your staff is the worst i ever met  whats up w flt  brothers fianc sitting on board for mins w tech  issues  is giving us free movies because apparently the dunkin donuts coffee is a safety hazard thingsyoucantmakeup switchsbux  as long as someone remembers to put it on plane right that was a really lame excusegeez  can do much better coffeeneeded  what else could possibly take the place of coffee at that hourhope pilot wasnt relying on aircraft for caffeine needcoffee  whats up with lack coffee on am flight was told someone forgot to load coffee onto the plane what ineedcoffee  dont get me wrong i love flying with you tv free bags

besides charging us three times in cash what we originally paid  i spent over an hour of my morning on hold w your customer support i want my confirmed flight to be taken care of    does it look like

working its staticy ithelpsabit  i have been on phone with rep for over  min and was transferred after asking not to be she was the worse rep i ever had  how is it possible the only way to contact

coffee on flight and my non stop now has an unscheduled stop  why wasnt a  service credit voucher i received for tv not working accepted on my next flight for a pillow s ceo battles to appease passengers and wall street     every crew member i dealt with in orlando was incredibly rude im actually pretty disgusted with jetblue right now  is it your standard protocol to call security onto a plane for a crying baby  finally starting to come out  minutes and no communication is not acceptable letting me down today  found someone to ask no answers landed almost  minutes ago  flight  bags havent come and we landed  minutes ago  gnight checked in at pos amp supervisor was unaware of policy that sucked having to guide him to the internet he was v unfriendly   hour delay while sitting on the plane and you still wanna charge me for beer nah im good  your customer services agent jorge at orlando international is rude and disrespectful i never want to deal with your bullshit ever  if it was simply a minor mechanical why would they say that  can you tweet closepwcs to get the word out  my mother had overheard a personnel ask the attendant if the passengers really knew what was going on and the attendant said no  what happened w from bossan my mother is onboard amp the crew was evasive as to why they had to return to bos the first time  it says it is now  you owe me  i want you to pay for my parking fee at orlando airport because your app told me my moms flight landed at  and it lied  they told us  minutes almost  minutes ago   fll to lga this is getting old th  flight in

out how about you reimburse the money you cause my band to lose  but you guys should know that musicians are very sensitive about the safety of their instruments when flying for good reason  ask  but i teach marketing at a university and will gladly consult on customer service and how not to treat passengers  loves to respond to positive tweets but they ignore problems w customers just ask nola musician  about that shameful  call was not made by the inflight crew they in fact asked us why we didnt bring it on  last week i bought a plane ticket round trip to fl amp just  fun i look at the price of them today and they went down nothappy  only middle seats sfo gt bos not fun she keeps getting  credits would much rather have a working tv  disappointed we werent allowed to bring on an aircraft approved carseat on an empty plane not cool  maybe have a supervisor find out why the international checkin at ftl hasnt moved in  minutes yet employees picked up  pizza  third flight in a row for my wife with her tv not working  what is a personal email that i can contact i have a complaint that you should know about  whats up with website cant access flight info  you are missing the point the flight left an hour late flight why are you allowed to be that late flight and still charge me  and hrs  nd time flying jetblue this year and my armrest tv controller doesnt work agianand thats the main reason i fly jetblue  its on me  thats not what you said last night though    the two of you should team up to serve cinnabons on the flights bonsinthesky  hey you guys remembered lol but now my bos flights delayed and turn the heat down in t it feels hotter than pr  spoken to  reps once im allowed to check my bag and through the tsa checkpoint i guarantee i will be talking to someone  and the min line i stood in to drop my bag off  got txt  min after sched dpt saying plane had just arrived  jfk late flightr txt w dpt gate change then  dpt for  flight  i was not allowed to drop my bag off for my flight that i was running min late flight for turns out it left over an hour late flight  my son left his ipad on flight  from jfk to fll on monday i called and left message and have no heard back seat a  all taken care of  other then the dropped call and the total half hour wait love jetblue  you stood me up last night but im giving you a second chance im just a boy tweeting an airline asking them to fly him home  waited for  min then got disconnect  is i cant make changes on the website am i still charged  dollars for using phone  your agents at iad have compounded this problem by not making any announcements jetbluemess  just a heads up this page no longer exists    wonder if thats the pilot tweeting you back is it legal to tweet and fly what if the plane in front stops suddenly  they say they have no update i dont work i dont get paid  jet blue has my money but no flight argh  no news here at the gate what are my options  well im glad i got up at  am so i can sit in an airport  no place else id rather be not   no  i am guessing i have to call someone  why  and not  as scheduled   iad to jfk still hasnt boarded whats todays excuse and how am i gonna get to work  why is t that every time i fly jfk even more speed doesnt work waiting for  min nogood  clients got zero in  years career never thought this was possible suitcases worth thousands of  in italian clothing robbed  not to mention the fact that we paid extra just to fly jetblue thinking it was the most reliable  we even went to the airport and were on the phone for hrs and no help at all everyone said different things  people kept saying it was due to weather but there were flights going directly to boston even after our flight  i understand but everyone said different things and there was a flight out late flightr that night but only one of us got to take it  disappointed that my flight back to boston from pr was cancelled flightledrebooked  the next daydelayed that one too and no compensation  she claimed that she did but i was not happy with the way i was treated  ripped my suitcase i then was yelled at with attitude from geraldine your employee at the baggage centerworst airline jetblue  shout out to the crew on flight  headed back to the big apple they kept my glass half full the whole flight jetbluejfk  that makes sense it sucks though because now ill be stuck in the airport for  hours and late flight to my meeting  the gate agent said our original plane got deicing fluid in the engine that created a short so they took the plane out of service   hour delay supposed to land at pm now its am still not boarding epicfail  i hope your system wasnt hacked cause someone elses passport info was on my reservation amp i couldnt get my boarding pass  honestly im glad you didnt cancelled flight the flight just that ill be driving home at  am now   bag just delivered and items have been stolen  at first look  my kate spade bag and bottle of spiced rum  wtf  im disappointed my flight was cancelled flighted mostly because i was excited to listen to the song im blue while flying on jetblue  flight delayed x and still not taking off on time amp greeting me at my seat yes its gum amp garbage   bag is supposedly here in boston  i dont know no one would tell me where they were coming from  i would guess so as thats where we had all the changes to flights  i get sunday due to weather and ok monday theyre busy but this is crazy  supervisor humiliated us and was uncompromising we were completely blindsided  offered to pay for tix at the airport bc we were never told that our reservation didnt go through was told i could pay  pp  right now completely pissed off  ive had no shampoo no winter coat no deodorant no flatiron and the rest if my stuff since sat  my sil bought tix for us to nyc we were told at the gate that her cc was declined supervisor accused us of illegal activity  dispatcher keeps yelling and hung up on me  now when i call its still at the warehouse and might be going out tonight  they couldnt do it sun then it was supposed to be mon after pm then today from  to  then from  to   flight from dca to bos has no heat ohno bundleup leastthebeverageswillbecold   unfortunately thats not an available option with our current system sorry guys thats a certain fail fix it plz  received horrible customer service at lax on  reservation cancelled flighted without notification despite having confirmation number  flight was cancelled flighted do i need to file a claim for the  credit im entitled to per yr bill of rights or will it just be issued  why not just take her info in the beginning and if cut off call back we do that in my medical practice we are frequent flyers   are there issues with the mobile boarding passes my app keeps crashing when i try accessing thanks  well your new baggage fees fare structures and reduced legroom has turned you into every other hated carrier in the us congrats  yes well they are operating outside of your terminal and targeting vulnerable passengers no better than thieves  thats not an option for us so how can we help each other fix this i wouldve made the change earlier if given accurate info  well now saying our flight is going to be cancelled flighted amp that by not changing earlier we missed our chance to get out tomorrow   tell your employees that  even  responded quicker via twitter when they fail still on hold hoping no one books the flight  fail  ah yes put the bags on the floor instead of the overhead bin so no one trips safetyfirst sarcasm  where exactly can i leave a note  guys really bad  fail  someone better call my wife back to get this handled  while she waits on hold  fail my wife on the phone asking to switch flight times in mid switch gets disconnected now cancelled flightled no new time no call back  they tried to have us towed do you think ill be flying out of your terminal again risk of  fine from corrupt police official  ticket issued whilst delivering your customers  understand that but this policy of targeting your passengers is not good for business and should be addressed with security always been a  fan but maybe next time ill fly  for real customer service  understood  but could i go and put myself on the standby list  hours prior to my flight  the whole plane hoping for better luck on the return flight sunday  so im penalized for packing lightly having  bag and paying extra for a seat  dropping passengers with small baby and  infants at your san juan terminal as unloading baby officer writes me ticket for   the tv wifi was spotty its just a nice feature for a x country flight still wont keep us away lovejetblue  so technically i could drive to jfk now and put in request for tomorrows flight  why did i pay for extra space to be forced to put my backpack under my seat its my only bag flight  unprofessional  we were on b  this morning from boston to beautiful san diego we really were bummed the satellite was broken   just lost my business   enjoy your profits  i would drive   hours to jfk to board jetblue to vegas instead of closer hartford airport cramming more seats on planeno more  yes today flight is full now they said no to me at gate   this is not a flight delay this is horrible planning on jet blue jetblue  insane the craziness ive seen with jet blue today at newark delayed  hours and now we are waiting for a pilot jetblue  we are delayed until he arrives   the highlight of being delayed freeconcert  whose performing at t  flight  first officer not even at the airport wow unreal staff waited until we all boarded to announce we are delayed   why does my tsapre work with every airline but you i pay good money for that spent  mins on phone to fix to zero success  yes

multiple times i just wait and when it finally connects i get hung up on  hold for  min a couple of rings then mailbox has not been set up yet customer service forwarding to their cell phones cmon  \\nbut if customer service ment anything to you you would try quoting policy is never effective customer service  \\napparently not  why are we delayed  flight   continue button generated a trip to plan your trip page\\nregardless of how far along i was in flight booking problems process\\nhint the end of it  remember  im very doubtful and not very hopeful   ill give u a chance but i dont think ill fall for it backtodelta   be responsible for replacing it   new stroller the travel credit doesnt help cover the cost of a new stroller your crew ruined it and therefore should   i just spoke to the baggage claim center and they gave me travel credit but will not be responsible for the cost of a  heard about the charge for st bag and tighter seats  no need to be a loyal jb customer anymore  is there something going on with your alerts flights been delayed several times for my parents and im not receiving any alerts  hard to tell but was told wifi only worked for one side of the plane  just learning about your famous apology in social media marketing is twitter an asset for jet blue now   i normally  you but this late flightst flight experience was the worst  hours on runway no wifi amp tv not working properly   it doesnt matter who you directed me to its the principle of the matter when i gate checked the stroller it was   days maybe  figured but delay is listed at almost  hrs thanks for being great cheers  glitches on website re flight booking problems travel amp checking in nothing between ur site amp the airport was communicated it was a nightmare  as much i have paid in fees plus hotel and food because of your changes i could had flown with a more reliable airline nojetblue  been dealing with a cancelled flightled flight since last night amp was booked to a  flightwouldve at least liked to see ella perform lol  and they are telling me i got to get another hotel and foodso spend more money because you guys made me miss my connection  already spent  to stay

with no practical knowledgeprovide me with a direct contact  got flight reschedule to flight form pit to fll and our flight had mechanical problems so we were delayed an hour missed my connect  my request has nothing to do with rescheduling but customer service has such a bad attitude today badservice  busy due to storm but customer service should always be on point more so now than ever

been three months and my miles    no one picks up the phone all day  no opportunity to leave a voicemail   instead the miles are credited to an account that i did not open\\n my request to merge the accounts is denied  no i was there  hrs early send me an email to share my experience you dont want this blasting here   i open the credit card and earn  miles and you wont credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles   you took the miles out of my account and told me that i could restore by paying  or opening a credit card    i had  miles in  my account and was informed id

terrible  i just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip  whats up with flight  no gate agent or plane at phx b  nice customer service  very embarrassing  im still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a flight attendant who isnt up on current policy to argue with a traveler  yes i know the industry procedure on baggage thanks for helping  what about the impossible connection that started this  i agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding amp we all sat in the plane for almost  hrs  and despite tailwind will still be late flight   characters are not enough to convey the issue was directed to emailmailtocustomerrelationscom unmonitored bad  i have and you have not been able to locate them its insane i trust you and pay you to look after my things and you lost them  and yet the flight attendant argued with me over exec plat benefits  please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check itfits    has me on my toes whether im going to make my flight back to boston tonight   need to check candy w working flight  iah to phx on usairways she is the reason i always choose  rude  yes ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very late flight   is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on  to sea leaving the same time this arrives is there a chance to hold  is anything being done to make flight attendants aware

and still cant get a response after a week unacceptable   i will never fly us airways again  strikes againlate flight crew  for the trip and maintenance   worth the extra trip for less hassle and fewer delays  so i get bumped to the pm to birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled dont have enough hours together fail  yes thanks but took forever  as far as being delayed goes looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it good news  horrible travel day w your airlines my  flight to birmingham was cancelled flightled w no notification so i couldnt get on the   i asked if that was sop and they said it is now but yet the other  flights nothing is this a policy or not   hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the us  hr layover and i get to watch it going to wrong destination  it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drinksnack detailed here  amp being argued with  i am so disappointed with the service i received with you on my travels to nc these past few days  you lost my baggage twice  have you just given up  and then you said i could move my thursday flight for free if i call a number and then you hang up on me  are you not even

trains to pbi  i fly quite a bit and its not difficult to communicate if agents let people know whats happening arrangements can be made  handled on the phone unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip which is why im so displeased  headed to nyc from clt funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan has happened twice more  i already let them know and sent  complaints  got a call back finally when i was asleep and there is no return call back   the flights werent from this morning it was  flights  on thursday and  on monday which turned into tuesday  i spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold sad badservice mergerdisaster  your customer service is a nightmare i have been on hold for  hour im a platinum member with aa and feel like its worthless  never lets me down every single flight gets delayed  sitting on the ground in charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy friday hope i make my connection  ive been standing on a very crowded bus for the past  mins for dcapit help    thanks but you cant my flight was cancelled flightled for maintenance reasons and the next available flight was too late flight for me  yes i was rebooked the next day weds thanks just upset that i lost  additional work days and paid for my own hotel losing  suppose i need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice let me try that route   fix this asap  no just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of we dont care were automated    you cancelled flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of ticket from phl to ewr really  im logged into a flight booking problems i need to add api before travelling to the states but i cannot see where to do it  now the plane is  degrees and we are burning up this is completely illegal  are you fucking kidding me   now siting on tarmac in philly for another  minutes this is so lame sorry doesnt help this is terrible  what is the damn delay  it would be nice to just pull up to the gate still sitting here  app is the worst one for airlines cant do anything once your original flight time has gone by useless  has completely wasted my work day thank you for the bad service and bad friday  and also its great that you tweet  complainers but what about the inperson help when i need it robyn f in manch  useless  youll be receiving a long amp detailed complaint letter soon long story short never flying usair again  thanks for making miss connection getting rebooked missing that too and a miserable day started my day  am for nothing  need to learn operations sit a plane overnight at gsp and not realize theres a mech problem then delay flight   hours  that the flight was delayed amp closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half bad bad service  why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate  he overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled you should refund me i had no choice grossedout  nothing was available male flight crew was not nicedismissive big guy was standby and probably didnt even pay for choice  well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on  i did not want to hang out on your plane all day when i am traveling to get work done and turn right back around unacceptable  doesnt seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in lax and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesnt help usairwaysfail  this is a complete waste of my day a trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day ridiculous  we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight  the plane is moving and its no ice we are moving to the end of the runway to sit because lga has one runway open   nothing was available male flight crew was not nicedismissive big guy was standby and probably didnt even pay  is setting themselves up for a lawsuit no way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half  i want to not sit on a plane from dca to lga for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight  this is so unacceptable im going for the day now most of my day will be sitting on your plane not to mention there is no air  is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half they didnt even let us off  hi is there somebody avail who can help with an refund  its unbelievable on the phone w us for more than  hrs in  days  plus a us airways  you need to do something about this i left philly to thaw out   ordered a scotch amp water and fa asked if i wanted full glass or half  yrs old and first time ever asked that  yeah the mark was like a mile back also were an hour late flight so thanks a ton for the great service today  we got  drink then fa sat in jump seat doing crosswords glasses picked up at landing just a very lazy service  first class  paid for a choice seat my choice is to not have big man next to me in my seat too oldseatnocushion worstflight nohelponboard  first class no snack basket was catered so drinks only no preflight drink or coathanging st drink service  min after take off  you told us last night that there was a ground stop at ohare four hours after obama landed stop blaming someone else   delayed due to frozentoilet medicalissue mechanicalissue dispatchissue weve heard it all letsgo  able does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w luggage that wont fit overhead  is the worst  minute delay in boston not weather relate flightd going to miss our connecting flight gassing up the plane issue  is the worst still havent left everyone missing connections  todays flight to philadelphia  its a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and its not even snowing in fl  i have been trying to book a flight using my miles for  straight days  min on phone  still havent talked to a human  gonna miss connecting flight delayed flying out of boston  on flight  waiting for weight and balance info for the past  minutes  thanks for taking my flight off the board and not providing and updates about my flight which is  minutes late flight  never again worse experience in my life   i rebooked myself  but cancelled flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable you started delaying at pm   hrs stranded in dcazero apologies and the worst customer service been a faithful traveler for  years but no more  this response doesnt correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated  been at dca at  pm still here at  am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane absolutely worse experience  it was  almost  hours late flight due  to mechanical  never flying usairways again horrible experience terrible customer service  unacceptable you knew the pilot wouldnt be able to complete the trip wasted all of our time  i have been on three planes for flight  and still havent left the ground bad service sad  then told to offload because the captain was over hours this has been a terrible experience  why were we loaded onto the plane  hours late flight mind you made to sit for  minutes  why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period unacceptable  offloading the plane this is ridiculous  that is actually not true you can get a seat online after a big hassle that policy is totally dishonest and misleading faa  that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us  thats incorrect four people last flight of the night with our bags horriblecustomerservice  the fact that you are making customers pay  to choose a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors  ill do that in addition to reviewing on my blog your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than   your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide shameonyou usairwayssucks  worst experience ever with you guyssee my blog tomorrow on my experience maybe you can help make it better  now the freezing bus is just doing circles  please explain i have plenty of time since im stranded  i doubt that its p amp we r still being held captive on the ground at dca a little communication from up front would b nice  why does it cost  to change a  ticket when it only cost  to purchase a new ticket   sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane what is up  we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary  doesnt want me to get home  they dont stand alone for me i bought tix based on usair confirmed flight what good is confirmation if you change it anyway  dcagthpn u r prof hostage takerswe stood on bus  plane for  minnow sitting on plane with no mvmt amp  announcement  gt hour   i bet you dont but im the paying customer here i know how to check for flight delays thank you  i cant even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive forcing me to purchase a new ticket  oh great after a  hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving  flight  has been awful  thats the st sorry i received from your company the least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge  never flying with you guys again extremely disorganized and too many delays  my buddies are currently delayed  hours and counting in dca on their ways to cae for a golf week any compensation flydelta  flights  was the delay flight  was my missed connection help  the flight that i did not connect to was   even when i

program is ripoffquick ticket fee  i hope you all end up on unemployment   bos gt dca delayed again this needs to stop i will be filing complaints with the faa and consumer affairs  sitting on the tarmac waiting to deplane  minutes the level of service ive come to expect  you gladly take the loyal customers money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused  the least you could do is make up for what you have caused you are ruining peoples memories you should be ashamed  st a late flight plane then missing flight crew then maintenance problems gates switched  times you call this customer service  due to your expensive change fees either out of all the airlines we chose yours all do you could screw us stranded no help  we cant afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home turns out we cant afford to go home  ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight and now we are stranded

to justify sticking with the us air cc and status  never fails to disappoint  platinum flyer bought tkt in aa also both accounts are linked so why cant i check in for flight tomorrow   your person

in dc my flight is delayed due to lack of crew us  no they dont  i think i already said that  no one responds  its an auto response  wait is this an auto response  started trying to reach a real person over an hour ago still no luck  us\\nmy wife in boston says no snow right now  i tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over  mins please hold we dont care  you see now that is a lie  they auto respond with insulting email sucks   how can i be stuck on a plane due to snow in boston when its not actually snowing in boston  usair flight  us  ive been waiting for desk for  and on hold min and countingphoto of desk agent on phone not flattering  you have cancelled flighted our flights  times over the past  daysand the experience has been the worstnever again  i realize the weather but day after day our flights keep getting cancelled flighted please prioritize ur passengers and help them  how does that help me when i get no response from there usairwayssucks    team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged  not happy blizzard  stop cancelled flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers strandedinnashville  strikes againlost bags and two of them theworst  had  cancelled flight my trip to la bc weather  was easy but us air is making me pay  to use the credit never again  whats the point of a baggage claim ticket if they dont scan it  for tracking  no access to dividend miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back late flightr frustrated livepersonplease  you cant even track my bag to see where it is its like its disappeared  cant get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles its been over a month since travel amp ive submitted twice online  i been sitting on this plane for  minutes and they are saying another  minutes something about paper work this sucks   is there gonna be a better day to call ive called on  separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person  i spent more on the room amp transportation then i did the whole flight  i ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that i had to spend  i asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service  only to come home a day late flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage  doubt it gate x is a cluster and every agent encounter i saw including one with me was outright rude just very put off  i have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport  the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do  so mad i cant even believe  you guys cancelled flight my connecting flight after i leave the first stop amp give me a useless hotel voucher  priorities should have been made considering a pending snow storm why delay a flight for an hour amp a half id like an answer  i experienced what defines customer service on flt a flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges  ive done everything still no luck in finding my bag i dont understand how my bag could have been misplaced very upsetting  that wasnt my q but thanks wondering why youre the only ones i disguised yours to not call you out    turns into  with such difficulty to past loyal customer as a aa platinum flyer usair couldnt be more unhelpful why yes but i will nvr fly w  i missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on ft couldnt see my father be they put him in a coma   minutes to put my tsa number in  mins and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct   so i would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone usairwayssucks  really so what does that mean usairwayssucks  nope done was supposed to get home at pm and didnt get home until midnight neveragain  the only way to assist is to actually answer the phone  would it kill you to give me  seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold  would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation  would it kill you to not let  miles expire  would it kill you to let me know how many minutes i might be on hold  a    totaled not happy not at all  i have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked replys usairwaysssuck  the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for  hours is i dont really know what happened  my number is   cant waitlol usairsucks  have him call me  i cant wait to see if anything happens  your service really sucksusairwayssucks   we hate delays have you tried any of these  although were not sure what a timbit is  big fail on not having curbside baggage in pittsburgh and you charge  dollars a bag  i hope so too thank you for your help she traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase  would you consider honoring the original fare price if i were to try flight booking problems the ticket again  booked an award ticket recently now same ticket is less miles how do i contact you without using the online form or phone  would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices  goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible  thats ok just know that ill most likely never book with you again  i followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around  your service sucks usairwayssuck  i dont mind waiting i mind waiting on a plane when i shouldnt have had to  the airport has more room and you know food  that is appreciated  however the system tells you call back late flightr then ends the call  no need to reply thanks  why would you board ppl on a plane b its their turn to deice why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process  i tried that before using twitter also gave me no helpful information thank you anyway  i am sure you are sincere in your apology its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers options  yeah i know thatbut now ill have to spend almost  dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week  yeah either by refunding my money or  free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through  \\nare you an incompetent airline every day or just days that end in y  there isnt a ticket numberthe transaction is still pending  do families no longer get early boarding with young kids  american your new

meal on my flight they would not  what airline serves food anymore update in policy  it is the nd person when i called again to ask could not catch her name rejected the request  must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook fendforyourself  that link is broken but if its the online baggage locator i already tried it and it gave me no useful information  spoke on the phone  or  times but no resolution im still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up  stranded in philly starving and cant get a meal voucher even though your plane had mechanical issue   next

guess your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform  as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand  bitchy flight attendants on  am flights are not appreciated  again no special meal catered for me in f jfklax thankfully im on qantas the rest of wayi fear what youd not cater on that   i did not get any compensation after cancelled flighting my departure twice and made me missed my own wedding   characters arent enough to describe how inconsiderate your employees are  your cabin thank you message reminds people about having choices when they fly i will be choosing another airline next time  really thats it not even a we are looking into this to see what happenedwhat we could do better next time  delayed aa  missed due to delay aa  new flight now delayed aa  she told us we had to drive back to drop it off so they could attempt to fix it really dont have time to do that terrible  the flight is the wrong day confirm  usxlon departure on  should be  for  people  having trouble flight booking problems a seat on us  march operated by aa neither airlines website will allow seat selection  thank you for the robotic and non helpful assistance  i fly weekly with you and havent seen one  i would love to say the same but its not so much hs flight no internet no personal ac yr old plane nofunatall  uwont allow memake changes online force mesit thru excess phone wait timesampstill insist charging crazy fees thats service  requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction  horrible service  luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude didnt help at all  thats a rather clunky process whoever designed that clearly doesnt understand email   your customer relations dept has oneway email how is not allowing responses helpful  if you are sorry answer my claims aa ref  and   accordingly without using weather  she has  the guy u served drinks   til he needed awheelchair to get off the plane is a more important then the assaulted women  theres a lot of talks and no doing \\nmiasfo on a  year old plane nonewplanes old shame   sorry that is a sad answer a fully refundable first fare and no response in  weeks  no more aa in my future   are you a bot haha always same lies from you  especially during a death in the family and still no solution  hours and countingthanks  fortunately the window seat was a noshow able to scoot over and create space  so great aa sitting for an hour first technical problems now what  this has to be the absolute worst experience ever  so i have to call back at  since the department is closed this has to be the biggest bunch of bull  just need to know why it wasnt done like it was promised it would yesterday  too late flight now boarded exit rows taken could not have gotten worse guy next  me shouldve bought  seats miserablemorning  restaff and commence new policies because your industry is so embarrassed by you   so who do i need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so i can get the credit for the charges   months of straight travel ahead time to find new airline  im flying into dca my bag is at iad  i am already late flight for my meetings at work  i will call the number when i land   face palm cannot believe the last  hrs  hrs of sleep and no and no and what you cant do  just wow regina just told me i cant file or request a lost bag statement until i finish my travel  so until i get to dc argg  i shared my experience several times aa ref but aas response is senseless weather was not the cause  you should be apologizing for your rude sales reps and failure to offer anything other than trite condescending platitudes  is non existent and i will take this as far as neededwhy hide behind a corporate logo provide a number tcf useless amateur  laxogglax using hard earned miles and was given lousy service faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag your customer care  they were no where to be found at midnight last night i would think the agent in lax could have relayed that infobag on flt  you cancelled flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat not acceptable upgrade to emergency row would help nothappy  is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a  bag and not replace and shrug the damage off flights from  it isnt good enough you need to provide a phone number other partners do should be investigated by    yes it is in dulles and i need it delivered to the embassy suites in herndon va im still in chicago from the fiasco in lax  whats the point so i can wait for another  weeks u r one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone  machines are broken lines are out the door for self service cust support and bag check in  would have been had i seen this before pm est when i was sound asleep  merged airlines do not work for ff programs very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care attitudeissues  when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think aa would want to earn your business but guess not  needs to get their shit together  counter people amp a massive line people need to catch their flights   i know your policy just asking for a little kindness due to extenuating circumstances  the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing  just wow   oh no she left the counter and went downstairs  then she told elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter   maybe long trip late flight night amp queues at baggage claims in two terminals no good i thought i paid for it  instead  you really need some customer service training for your unhappy ees in the morning in chicago gate k at  chking her schd   i sat on the runway for  more hrs b takeoff  hrs late flight  am pilot plainly stated it was a compmech issue  alright prove it   days ago i sat on a plane at jfk for  hrs deplaned for  more and when i reboarded  im trying to choose my seats but every time i go to the next flight i get system error  policy makers need to change their mindset on aviation flying is not for   leave us stranded send baggage with important medication to different city for daysampapologise with a  voucher appalling  ive been trying to change a thursday flight and theres a ridiculous wait time on the phone and your website isnt helping  we all did skippers walkaround too   thank you for the acknowledgement the ife didnt work all that well anyway so maybe time to upgrade to lower profile system  thanks for the canned reply  just went to check into flight  hr advance again husband and i are seated separately for hr flight why does this happen  no i just expect a higher level of customer service amp for the flight crews to give us accurate information  or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was cancelled flightled  i tried when i landed but there was noone there  ive emailed your customer service twice now who dont seem to care  no ive since rebooked with another airline what i would like is compensation for all the timemoney lost  nothing you have done enough  i was

employees at lax  i tried extremely rude even the supervisor and when i asked to speak to his supervisor i was told no  yes but you are still human i hope dealing with all the horror stories people share i complained to dot everyone should  try contacting everyone on that flight with a refund offer and we might believe you are sincere  i have filed multiple complaints i prefer to continue warning the public instead of wasting more time with this inhumane corp  worst experience of my life avoid at all costs they will lose your belongings and have no humanity to even offer compensation  terror story my luggage was delayed both ways on an international flight for over  days total angrycustomer  worst service ever delayed flights for more than  hours plus you missed my bag and your employees are rude   thanks for the generic computer generated response how about you accommodate your travelers instead of just saying sorry  they are giving cots to the people that did not get hotel roomsthat is terrible  i did twicegot a letter back saying that your company doesnt issue refunds for phone bills helpphone will be shut off  ty but their site says  please note that we do not offer a print subscription service for american way   its not weather thats why i said the other people received hotel rooms while the people at the end of the line did not get them  after losing my bags for  daysampcharging me  toarrange pick upin argentinaclaiming tollfree wont reimburse me help  pity that a machine replied or perhaps my story not unusual expected better response given article in
